Conversion Indicators
=====================

This submodule contains indicators that convert units of input data to other units.
For example, converting temperature from Kelvin to Celsius or precipitation from kg m-2 s-1 to mm day-1.
It also includes indicators that convert between related physical quantities, such as converting
snow depth to snow water equivalent or wind speed to wind power density.
