0.10.x-beta (2019-06-18)
------------------------
* Added indices to ICCLIM module.
* Added indices `days_over_precip_thresh` and `fraction_over_precip_thresh`.
* Migrated to a `major.minor.patch-release` semantic versioning system.
* Removed attributes in netCDF output from Indicators that are not in the CF-convention.
* Added `fit` indicator to fit the parameters of a distribution to a series.
* Added utilities with ensemble, run length, and subset algorithms to the documentation.
* Source code development standards now implement Python Black formatting.
* Pre-commit is now used to launch code formatting inspections for local development.
* Documentation now includes more detailed usage and an example workflow notebook.
* Development build configurations are now available via both Anaconda and pip install methods.
* Modified create_ensembles() to allow creation of ensemble dataset without a time dimension as well as from xr.Datasets.
* Modified create ensembles() to pad input data with nans when time dimensions are unequal.
* Updated subset_gridpoint() and subset_bbox() to use .sel method if 'lon' and 'lat' dims are present.
* *Added Azure Pipelines to automatically build xclim in Microsoft Windows environments.* -- **REMOVED**
* Now employing PEP8 + Black compatible autoformatting.
* Added Windows and macOS images to Travis CI build ensemble.
* Added variable thresholds for tasmax and tasmin in daily_freezethaw_events.

0.10-beta (2019-06-06)
----------------------
* Dropped support for Python 2.
* Added support for *period of the year* subsetting in ``checks.missing_any``.
* Now allow for passing positive longitude values when subsetting data with negative longitudes.
* Improved runlength calculations for small grid size arrays via ``ufunc_1dim`` flag.

0.9-beta (2019-05-13)
---------------------
This is a significant jump in the release. Many modifications have been made and will be added to the documentation in the coming days. Among the many changes:

* New indices have been added with documentation and call examples.
* Run_length based operations have been optimized.
* Support for CF non-standard calendars.
* Automated/improved unit conversion and management via pint library.
* Added ensemble utilities for creation and analysis of muti-model climate ensembles.
* Added subsetting utilities for spatio-temporal subsets of xarray data objects.
* Added streamflow indicators.
* Refactoring of the code : separation of indices.py into a directory with sub-files (simple, threshold and multivariate); ensembles and subset utilities separated into distinct modules (pulled from utils.py).
* Indicators are now split into packages named by realms. import xclim.atmos to load indicators related to atmospheric variables.

0.8-beta (2019-02-11)
---------------------
*This was a staging release and is functionally identical to 0.7-beta*.

0.7-beta (2019-02-05)
---------------------
Major Changes:

* Support for resampling of data structured using non-standard CF-Time calendars.
* Added several ICCLIM and other indicators.
* Dropped support for Python 3.4.
* Now under Apache v2.0 license.
* Stable PyPI-based dependencies.
* Dask optimizations for better memory management.
* Introduced class-based indicator calculations with data integrity verification and CF-Compliant-like metadata writing functionality.

Class-based indicators are new methods that allow index calculation with error-checking and provide on-the-fly metadata checks for CF-Compliant (and CF-compliant-like) data that are passed to them. When written to NetCDF, outputs of these indicators will append appropriate metadata based on the indicator, threshold values, moving window length, and time period / resampling frequency examined.

0.6-alpha (2018-10-03)
----------------------
* File attributes checks.
* Added daily downsampler function.
* Better documentation on ICCLIM indices.

0.5-alpha (2018-09-26)
----------------------
* Added total precipitation indicator.

0.4-alpha (2018-09-14)
----------------------
* Fully PEP8 compliant and available under MIT License.

0.3-alpha (2018-09-4)
---------------------
* Added icclim module.
* Reworked documentation, docs theme.

0.2-alpha (2018-08-27)
----------------------
* Added first indices.

0.1.0-dev (2018-08-23)
----------------------
* First release on PyPI.
