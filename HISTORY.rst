0.8-beta (2019-02-11)
---------------------
*This was a staging release and is functionally identical to 0.7-beta*.

0.7-beta (2019-02-05)
---------------------
Major Changes:

* Support for resampling of data structured using non-standard CF-Time calendars.
* Added several ICCLIM and other indicators.

* Now under Apache v2.0 license.
* Stable PyPI-based dependencies.
* Dask optimizations for better memory management.

Class-based indicators are new methods that allow index calculation with error-checking and provide on-the-fly metadata checks for CF-Compliant (and CF-compliant-like) data that are passed to them. When written to NetCDF, outputs of these indicators will append appropriate metadata based on the indicator, threshold values, moving window length, and time period / resampling frequency examined.
