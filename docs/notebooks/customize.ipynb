    "## Defining new indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "xclim's Indicators are instances of (subclasses of) `xclim.core.indicator.Indicator`. While they are the central to xclim, their construction can be somewhat tricky as a lot happens backstage. Essentially, they act as self-aware functions, taking a set of input variables (DataArrays) and parameters (usually strings, integers or floats), performing some health checks on them and returning one or multiple DataArrays, with CF-compliant (and potentially translated) metadata attributes, masked according to a given missing value set of rules.\n",
    "They define the following key attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the `identifier`, as string that uniquely identifies the indicator,\n",
    "- the `realm`, one of \"atmos\", \"land\", \"seaIce\" or \"ocean\", classifying the domain of use of the indicator.\n",
    "- the `compute` function that returns one or more DataArrays, the \"indice\",\n",
    "- the `cfcheck` and `datacheck` methods that make sure the inputs are appropriate and valid.\n",
    "- the `missing` function that masks elements based on null values in the input.\n",
    "- all metadata attributes that will be attributed to the output and that document the indicator:\n",
    "    - Indicator-level attribute are : `title`, `abstract`, `keywords`, `references` and `notes`.\n",
    "    - Ouput variables attributes (respecting CF conventions) are: `var_name`, `standard_name`, `long_name`, `units`, `cell_methods`, `description` and `comment`. \n",
    "\n",
    "See the [class documentation](../api.rst#indicator-tools) for more info on the meaning of each attribute. The [indicators](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/tree/master/xclim/indicators) module contains over 50 examples of indicators to draw inspiration from.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Metadata parsing vs explicit setting\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained above, most metadata can be parsed from the indice's signature and docstring. Otherwise, it can always be set when creating a new Indicator instance *or* a new subclass. When _creating_ an indicator, output metadata attributes can be given as strings, or list of strings in the case of indicator returning multiple outputs. However, they are stored in the `cf_attrs` list of dictionaries on the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Internationalization of metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "xclim offers the possibility to translate the main Indicator metadata field and automatically add the translations to the outputs. The mechnanic is explained in the [Internationalization](../internationalization.rst) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inputs and checks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways that xclim uses to decide which input arguments of the indicator's call function are considered _variables_ and which are _parameters_. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The `_nvar` indicator integer attribute sets the number of arguments that are sent to the `datacheck` and `cfcheck` methods (in the signature's order).\n",
