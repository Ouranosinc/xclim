    "# Frequency analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency analysis refers to the study of the probability of occurrence of events. It's often used in regulatory contexts to determine design values for infrastructures. For example, your city might require that road drainage systems be able to cope with a level of rainfall that is exceeded only once every 20 years on average. This 20-year return event, the infrastructure *design value*, is computed by first extracting precipitation annual maxima from a rainfall observation time series, fitting a statistical distribution to the maxima, then estimating the 95th percentile (1:20 chance of being exceeded).\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate this type of analysis on numerous time series from model simulations or observations, `xclim` packs a few common utility functions. In the following example, we're estimating the 95th percentile of the daily precipitation maximum over the May-October period using a Generalized Extreme Value distribution.\n",

    "Note that at the moment, all frequency analysis functions are hard-coded to operate along the `time` dimension.\n",

This is done by the `.fit` method, which takes as argument the sample series, the distribution's name and the parameter estimation method. The fit is done by default using the Maximum Likelihood algorithm. For some extreme value distributions, however, the maximum likelihood is not always robust, and `xclim` offers the possibility to use Probability Weighted Moments (PWM) to estimate parameters. Note that the `lmoments3` package which is used by `xclim` to compute the PWM only supports `expon`, `gamma`, `genextreme`, `genpareto`, `gumbel_r`, `pearson3` and `weibull_min`."

    "As a convenience utility, the two last steps (`fit` and `parametric_quantile`) are bundled into the `fa` function, which takes care of converting the return period into a quantile value, and renames the `quantile` output dimension to `return_period`. This dimension renaming is done to avoid name clashes with the `quantile` method. Indeed, it's often necessary when analysing large ensembles, or probabilistic samples, to compute the quantiles of the quantiles, which will cause `xarray` to raise an error. The `mode` argument specifies whether we are working with maxima (max) or minima (min). This is important because a 100-year return period value for minima corresponds to a 0.01 quantile, while a 100-year return period value for maxima corresponds to a 0.99 quantile."

Practitioners usually do not want to ignore entire years of data due to a few missing days, so one option is to record annual maxima only if there are no more than a given percentage of missing values, say 5%. These kinds of filters can easily be applied using `xclim`."
