    "# Statistical Downscaling and Bias-Adjustment - Advanced tools\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous notebook covered the most common utilities of `xclim.sdba` for conventional cases. Here, we explore more advanced usage of `xclim.sdba` tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimization with dask\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjustment processes can be very heavy when we need to compute them over large regions and long timeseries. Using small groupings (like `time.dayofyear`) adds precision and robustness, but also decouples the load and computing complexity. Fortunately, unlike the heroic pioneers of scientific computing who managed to write parallelized FORTRAN, we now have [dask](https://dask.org/). With only a few parameters, we can magically distribute the computing load to multiple workers and threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good first read on the use of dask within xarray are the latter's [Optimization tips](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/user-guide/dask.html#optimization-tips).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some `xclim.sdba`-specific tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most adjustment method will need to perform operation on the whole `time` coordinate, so it is best to optimize chunking along the other dimensions. This is often different from how public data is shared, where more universal 3D chunks are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Chunking of outputs can be controlled in xarray's [to_netcdf](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.to_netcdf.html?highlight=to_netcdf#xarray.Dataset.to_netcdf). We also suggest using [Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) files. According to [its creators](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFMIN33A..06A/abstract), `zarr` stores should give better performances, especially because of their better ability for parallel I/O. See [Dataset.to_zarr](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.to_zarr.html?highlight=to_zarr#xarray.Dataset.to_zarr) and this useful [rechunking package](https://rechunker.readthedocs.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* One of the main bottleneck for adjustments with small groups is that dask needs to build and optimize an enormous task graph. This issue has been greatly reduced with xclim 0.27 and the use of `map_blocks` in the adjustment methods. However, not all adjustment methods use this optimized syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In order to help dask, one can split the processing in parts. For splitting training and adjustment, see [the section below](#Initializing-an-Adjustment-object-from-a-training-dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Another massive bottleneck of parallelization of `xarray` is the thread-locking behaviour of some methods. It is quite difficult to isolate and avoid these locking instances, so one of the best workarounds is to use `dask` configurations with many _processes_ and few _threads_. The former do not share memory and thus are not impacted when a lock is activated from a thread in another worker. However, this adds many memory transfer operations and, by experience, reduces dask's ability to parallelize some pipelines. Such a dask Client is usually created with a large `n_workers` and a small `threads_per_worker`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sometimes, datasets have auxiliary coordinates (for example : lat / lon in a rotated pole dataset). Xarray handles these variables as data variables and will **not** load them if dask is used. However, in some operations, `xclim` or `xarray` will trigger access to those variables, triggering computations each time, since they are `dask`-based. To avoid this behaviour, one can load the coordinates, or simply remove them from the inputs."

    "## LOESS smoothing and detrending\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in Cleveland (1979), locally weighted linear regressions are multiple regression methods using a nearest-neighbour approach. Instead of using all data points to compute a linear or polynomial regression, LOESS algorithms compute a local regression for each point in the dataset, using only the k-nearest neighbours as selected by a weighting function. This weighting function must fulfill some strict requirements, see the doc of `xclim.sdba.loess.loess_smoothing` for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In xclim's implementation, the user can choose between local _constancy_ ($d=0$, local estimates are weighted averages) and local _linearity_ ($d=1$, local estimates are taken from linear regressions). Two weighting functions are currently implemented : \"tricube\" ($w(x) = (1 - x^3)^3$) and \"gaussian\" ($w(x) = e^{-x^2 / 2\\sigma^2}$). Finally, the number of Cleveland's _robustifying iterations_ is controllable through `niter`. After computing an estimate of $y(x)$, the weights are modulated by a function of the distance between the estimate and the points and the procedure is started over. These iterations are made to weaken the effect of outliers on the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next example shows the application of the LOESS to daily temperature data. The black line and dot are the estimated $y$, outputs of the `sdba.loess.loess_smoothing` function, using local linear regression (passing $d = 1$), a window spanning 20% ($f = 0.2$) of the domain, the \"tricube\" weighting function and only one iteration. The red curve illustrates the weighting function on January 1st 2014, where the red circles are the nearest-neighbours used in the estimation."

These requirements often ensure conservation of statistical properties and a better representation of the climate change signal over the long adjusted timeseries.\n",

The \"construct\" function cuts the data in overlapping windows of a certain length (in years) and stacks them along a new `\"movingdim\"` dimension, alike to xarray's `da.rolling(time=win).construct('movingdim')`, but with yearly steps. The step between each window can also be controlled. This argument is an indicator of how many years overlap between each window. With a value of 1 (the default), a window will have `window - 1` years overlapping with the previous one. `step = window` will result in no overlap at all.\n",

    "\n",
    "The \"unpack\" function does the opposite : it concatenates the windows together to recreate the original timeseries.\n",
    "The time points that are not part of a window will not appear in the reconstructed timeseries.\n",
    "If `append_ends` is True, the reconstructed timeseries will go from the first time point of the first window to the last time point of the last window. In the middle, the central `step` years are kept from each window.\n",
    "If `append_ends` is False, only the central `step` years are kept from each window. Which means the final timeseries has  `(window - step) / 2` years missing on either side, with the extra year missing on the right in case of an odd `(window - step)`. We are missing data, but the contribution from each window is equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, as `ref` and `hist` cover 15 years, we will use a window of 15 on sim. With a step of two (2), this means the first window goes from 2000 to 2014 (inclusive). The last window goes from 2016 to 2030. `window - step = 13`, so six (6) years will be missing at the beginning of the final `scen` and seven (7) years at the end."

    "## Full example: Multivariate adjustment in the additive space\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example shows a complete bias-adjustment workflow using the `PrincipalComponents` method in a multi-variate configuration. Moreover, it uses the trick showed by [Alavoine et Grenier (2022)](https://doi.org/10.31223/X5C34C) to transform \"multiplicative\" variable to the \"additive\" space using log and logit transformations. This way, we can perform multi-variate adjustment with variables that couldn't be used in the same _kind_ of adjustment, like \"tas\" and \"hurs\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We will transform the variables that need it to the additive space, adding some jitter in the process to avoid $log(0)$ situations. Then, we will stack the different variables into a single `DataArray`, allowing us to use `PrincipalComponents` in a multi-variate way. Following the PCA, a simple quantile-mapping method is used, both adjustment acting on the residuals, while the mean of the simulated trend is adjusted on its own. Each step will be explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, open the data, convert the calendar and the units. Because we will perform adjustments on \"dayofyear\" groups (with a window), keeping standard calendars results in an extra \"dayofyear\" with only a quarter of the data. It's usual to transform to a \"noleap\" calendar, which drops the 29th of February, as it only has a small impact on the data."
