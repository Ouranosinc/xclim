    "# Statistical Downscaling and Bias-Adjustment - Advanced tools\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous notebook covered the most common utilities of `xclim.sdba` for conventionnal cases. Here we explore more advanced usage of `xclim.sdba` tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimization with dask\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjustment processes can be very heavy when we need to compute them over large regions and long timeseries. Using small groupings (like `time.dayofyear` ) adds precision and robustness, but also decuplates the load and computing complexity. Fortunately, unlike the heroic pioneers of scientific computing who managed to write parallelized Fortran, we now have [dask](https://dask.org/). With only a few parameters, we can magically distribute the computing load to multiple workers and threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good first read on the use of dask within xarray are the latter's [Optimization tips](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/dask.html#optimization-tips).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some xclim.sdba-specific tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most adjustment method will need to perform operation on the whole `time` coordinate, so it is best to optimize chunking along the other dimensions. This is often different from how public data is shared, where more universal 3D chunks are used. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Chunking of outputs can be controlled in xarray's [to_netcdf](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.to_netcdf.html?highlight=to_netcdf#xarray.Dataset.to_netcdf). We also suggest using [Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) files. According to [its creators](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFMIN33A..06A/abstract), `zarr` stores should give better performances, especially because of their better ability for parallel I/O. See [Dataset.to_zarr](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.to_zarr.html?highlight=to_zarr#xarray.Dataset.to_zarr) and this useful [rechunking package](https://rechunker.readthedocs.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* One of the main bottleneck for adjustments with small groups is that dask needs to build and optimize an enormous task graph. This issue has been greatly reduced with xclim 0.27 and the use of `map_blocks` in the adjustment methods. However, not all adjustment methods use this optimized syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In order to help dask, one can split the processing in parts. For splitting traning and adjustment, see [the section below](#Initializing-an-Adjustment-object-from-a-training-dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Another massive bottleneck of parallelization of xarray is the thread-locking behaviour of some methods. It is quite difficult to isolate and avoid those locking, so one of the best workaround is to use Dask configurations with many _processes_ and few _threads_. The former do not share memory and thus are not impacted when the other is locked. However, this adds many memory transfer operations and, by experience, reduces dask's ability to parallelize some pipelines. \n",
    " \n",
    "   This is done usually by creating a dask client with a large `n_workers` and a small `threads_per_worker`. The last section of this notebook goes into a bit more details by suggesting a template for large-scale bias-adjustment pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sometimes, datasets have auxiliary coordinates (for example : lat / lon in a rotated pole dataset). Xarray handles these variables as data variables and will **not** load them if dask is used. However, in some operations, xclim or xarray will trigger an access to those variables, triggering computations each time, since they are dask-backed. To avoid this behaviour, one can load the coordinates, or simply remove them from the inputs."

    "## LOESS smoothing and detrending\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in Cleveland (1979), locally weighted linear regressions are multiple regression methods using a nearest-neighbor approach. Instead of using all data points to compute a linear or polynomial regression, LOESS algorithms compute a local regression for each point in the dataset, using only the k-nearest neighbors as selected by a weighting function. This weighting function must fulfill some strict requirements, see the doc of `xclim.sdba.loess.loess_smoothing` for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In xclim's implementation, the user can choose between local _constancy_ ($d=0$, local estimates are weighted averages) and local _linearity_ ($d=1$, local estimates are taken from linear regressions). Two weighting functions are currently implemented : \"tricube\" ($w(x) = (1 - x^3)^3$) and \"gaussian\" ($w(x) = e^{-x^2 / 2\\sigma^2}$). Finally, the number of Cleveland's _robustifying iterations_ is controllable through `niter`. After computing an estimate of $y(x)$, the weights are modulated by a function of the distance between the estimate and the points and the procedure is started over. These iterations are made to weaken the effect of outliers on the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next example shows the application of the LOESS to daily temperature data. The black line and dot are the estimated $y$, outputs of the `sdba.loess.loess_smoothing` function, using local linear regression (passing $d = 1$), a window spanning 20% ($f = 0.2$) of the domain, the \"tricube\" weighting function and only one iteration. The red curve illustrates the weighting function on January 1st 2014, where the red circles are the nearest-neighbors used in the estimation."

This requirements often ensure conservation of statistical properties and a better representation of the climate change signal over the long adjusted timeseries.\n",

The \"construct\" function cuts the data in overlapping windows of a certain length (in years) and stacks them along a new `\"movingdim\"` dimension, alike to xarray's `da.rolling(time=win).construct('movingdim')`, but with yearly steps. The step between each window can also be controlled. This argument is an indicator of how many years overlap between each window. With a value of 1 (the default), a window will have `window - 1` years overlapping with the previous one. `step = window` will result in no overlap at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the result is chunked along this `'movingdim'` dimension. For this reason, the method is expected to be more computationally efficient (when using `dask`) than looping over the windows.\n",

    "2. The input timeseries must be in a calendar with uniform year lengths. For daily data, this means only the \"360_day\", \"noleap\" and \"all_leap\" calendars are supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"unpack\" function does the opposite : it concatenates the windows together to recreate the original timeseries. Only the central `step` years are kept from each window. Which means the final timeseries has  `(window - step) / 2` years missing on either side, with the extra year missing on the right in case of an odd `(window - step)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, as`ref` and `hist` cover 15 years, we will use a window of 15 on sim. With a step of 2, this means the first window goes from 2000 to 2014 (inclusive). The last window goes from 2016 to 2030. `window - step = 13`, so 6 years will be missing at the beginning of the final `scen` and 7 years at the end."
