    "# Extending xclim\n",
    "\n",
    "`xclim` tries to make it easy for users to add their own indices and indicators. The following goes into details on how to create `**Indices**` and document them so that xclim can parse most of the metadata directly. We then explain the multiple ways new `**Indicators**` can be created and, finally, how we can regroup and structure them in virtual submodules.\n",

    " * Performs **no** other checks or set any (non-unit) metadata.\n",
    " * Accessible through [xclim.indices](../indices.rst).\n",
    "\n",
    "### indicator\n",
    "\n",
    " * An instance of a subclass of `xclim.core.indicator.Indicator` that wraps around an `index` (stored in its `compute` property).\n",
    " * Returns one or several DataArrays.\n",
    " * Handles missing values, performs input data and metadata checks (see [usage](usage.ipynb#indicators)).\n",

    "### Naming and conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names should correspond to CMIP6 variables, whenever possible. The file `xclim/data/variables.yml` lists all variables that xclim can use when generating indicators from YAML files (see below), and new indices should try to reflect these also.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generic functions for common operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The [xclim.indices.generic](../indices.rst#generic-indices-submodule) submodule contains useful functions for common computations (like `threshold_count` or `select_resample_op`) and many basic index functions, as defined by [clix-meta](https://github.com/clix-meta/clix-meta). In order to reduce duplicate code, their use is recommended for xclim's indices. As previously said, the units handling has to be made explicitly when non-trivial, [xclim.core.units](../api.rst#units-handling-submodule) also exposes a few helpers for that (like `convert_units_to`, `to_agg_units` or `rate2amount`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in both example, a certain level of convention is best followed when writing the docstring of the index function. The general structure follows the NumpyDoc conventions, and some fields might be parsed when creating the indicator (see the image above and the section below). If you are contributing to the xclim codebase, when adding a citation to the docstring, this is best done by adding that reference to the ``references.bib`` file and then citing it using its label with the `:cite:cts:` directive (or one of its variant). See the [contributing docs](../contributing.rst#write-Documentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining new indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "xclim's Indicators are instances of (subclasses of) `xclim.core.indicator.Indicator`. While they are the central to xclim, their construction can be somewhat tricky as a lot happens backstage. Essentially, they act as self-aware functions, taking a set of input variables (DataArrays) and parameters (usually strings, integers or floats), performing some health checks on them and returning one or multiple DataArrays, with CF-compliant (and potentially translated) metadata attributes, masked according to a given missing value set of rules.\n",
    "They define the following key attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the `identifier`, as string that uniquely identifies the indicator, usually all caps.\n",
    "* the `realm`, one of \"atmos\", \"land\", \"seaIce\" or \"ocean\", classifying the domain of use of the indicator.\n",
    "* the `compute` function that returns one or more DataArrays, the \"index\",\n",
    "* the `cfcheck` and `datacheck` methods that make sure the inputs are appropriate and valid.\n",
    "* the `missing` function that masks elements based on null values in the input.\n",
    "* all metadata attributes that will be attributed to the output and that document the indicator:\n",
    "    - Indicator-level attribute are : `title`, `abstract`, `keywords`, `references` and `notes`.\n",
    "    - Output variables attributes (respecting CF conventions) are: `var_name`, `standard_name`, `long_name`, `units`, `cell_methods`, `description` and `comment`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output variables attributes are regrouped in `Indicator.cf_attrs` and input parameters are documented in `Indicator.parameters`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particularity of Indicators is that each instance corresponds to a single class: when creating a new indicator, a new class is automatically created. This is done for easy construction of indicators based on others, like shown further down.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [class documentation](../api.rst#indicator-tools) for more info on the meaning of each attribute. The [indicators](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/tree/master/xclim/indicators) module contains over 50 examples of indicators to draw inspiration from.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifier vs python name\n",
    "\n",
    "An indicator's identifier is **not** the same as the name it has within the python module. For example, `xclim.atmos.relative_humidity` has `hurs` as its identifier. As explained below, indicator _classes_ can be accessed through `xclim.core.indicator.registry` with their _identifier_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metadata parsing vs explicit setting\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained above, most metadata can be parsed from the index's signature and docstring. Otherwise, it can always be set when creating a new Indicator instance *or* a new subclass. When _creating_ an indicator, output metadata attributes can be given as strings, or list of strings in the case of an indicator returning multiple outputs. However, they are stored in the `cf_attrs` list of dictionaries on the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Internationalization of metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "xclim offers the possibility to translate the main Indicator metadata field and automatically add the translations to the outputs. The mechanic is explained in the [Internationalization](../internationalization.rst) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs and checks\n",
    "\n",
    "xclim decides which input arguments of the indicator's call function are considered _variables_ and which are _parameters_ using the annotations of the underlying index (the `compute` method). Arguments annotated with the `xarray.DataArray` type are considered _variables_ and can be read from the dataset passed in `ds`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indicator creation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways of creating indicators:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) By initializing an existing indicator (sub)class\n",
    "2) From a dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "The first method is best when defining indicators in scripts or external modules and are explained here. The second is best used when building virtual modules through YAML files, and is explained further down and in the [submodule doc](../api.rst#indicator-tools).\n",
