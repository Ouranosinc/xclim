    "# Extending xclim\n",
    "\n",
    "xclim tries to make it easy for users to add their own indices and indicators. The following goes into details on how to create _indices_ and document them so that xclim can parse most of the metadata directly. We then explain the multiple ways new _Indicators_ can be created and, finally, how we can regroup and structure them in virtual submodules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Central to xclim are the **Indicators**, objects computating indices over climate variables, but xclim also provides other modules:\n",

    "\n",
    " * A python function accepting DataArrays and other parameters (usually bultin types)\n",
    " * Returns one or several DataArrays. \n",
    " * Handles the units : checks input units and set proper CF-compliant output units. But doesn't usually prescribe specific units, the output will at minimum have the proper dimensionality.\n",
    " * Performs **no** other checks or set any (non-unit) metadata.\n",
    " * Accessible through [xclim.indices](../indices.rst).\n",
    " \n",
    "### indicator\n",
    "\n",
    " * An instance of a subclass of `xclim.core.indicator.Indicator` that wraps around an `indice` (stored in its `compute` property). \n",
    " * Returns one or several DataArrays.\n",
    " * Handles missing values, performs input data and metadata checks (see [usage](usage.ipynb#Health-checks-and-metadata-attributes)).\n",
    " * Always ouputs data in the same units.\n",
    " * Adds dynamically generated metadata to the output after computation.\n",
    " * Accessible through [xclim.indicatorsÂ ](../indicators_api.rst)\n",

    "### Naming and conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names should correspond to CMIP6 variables, whenever possible. The file `xclim/data/variables.yml` lists all variables that xclim can use when generating indicators from yaml files (see below), and new indices should try to reflect these also. For new variables, the  `xclim.testing.get_all_CMIP6_variables` function downloads the official table of CMIP6 variables and puts everything in a dictionary. If possible, use variables names from this list, add them to `variables.yml` as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generic functions for common operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The [xclim.indices.generic](../indices.rst#generic-indices-submodule) submodule contains useful functions for common computations (like `threshold_count` or `select_resample_op`) and many basic indice functions, as defined by [clix-meta](https://github.com/clix-meta/clix-meta). In order to reduce duplicate code, their use is recommended for xclim's indices. As previously said, the units handling has to be made explicitly when non trivial, [xclim.core.units](../api.rst#module-xclim.core.units) also exposes a few helpers for that (like `convert_units_to`, `to_agg_units` or `rate2amount`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining new indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "xclim's Indicators are instances of (subclasses of) `xclim.core.indicator.Indicator`. While they are the central to xclim, their construction can be somewhat tricky as a lot happens backstage. Essentially, they act as self-aware functions, taking a set of input variables (DataArrays) and parameters (usually strings, integers or floats), performing some health checks on them and returning one or multiple DataArrays, with CF-compliant (and potentially translated) metadata attributes, masked according to a given missing value set of rules.\n",
    "They define the following key attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the `identifier`, as string that uniquely identifies the indicator,\n",
    "* the `realm`, one of \"atmos\", \"land\", \"seaIce\" or \"ocean\", classifying the domain of use of the indicator.\n",
    "* the `compute` function that returns one or more DataArrays, the \"indice\",\n",
    "* the `cfcheck` and `datacheck` methods that make sure the inputs are appropriate and valid.\n",
    "* the `missing` function that masks elements based on null values in the input.\n",
    "* all metadata attributes that will be attributed to the output and that document the indicator:\n",
    "    - Indicator-level attribute are : `title`, `abstract`, `keywords`, `references` and `notes`.\n",
    "    - Ouput variables attributes (respecting CF conventions) are: `var_name`, `standard_name`, `long_name`, `units`, `cell_methods`, `description` and `comment`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Output variables attributes are regrouped in `Indicator.cf_attrs` and input parameters are documented in `Indicator.parameters`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particularity of Indicators is that each instance corresponds to a single class: when creating a new indicator, a new class is automatically created. This is done for easy construction of indicators based on others, like shown further down.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [class documentation](../api.rst#module-xclim.core.indicator) for more info on the meaning of each attribute. The [indicators](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/tree/master/xclim/indicators) module contains over 50 examples of indicators to draw inspiration from.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metadata parsing vs explicit setting\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained above, most metadata can be parsed from the indice's signature and docstring. Otherwise, it can always be set when creating a new Indicator instance *or* a new subclass. When _creating_ an indicator, output metadata attributes can be given as strings, or list of strings in the case of indicator returning multiple outputs. However, they are stored in the `cf_attrs` list of dictionaries on the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Internationalization of metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "xclim offers the possibility to translate the main Indicator metadata field and automatically add the translations to the outputs. The mechnanic is explained in the [Internationalization](../internationalization.rst) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs and checks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways that xclim uses to decide which input arguments of the indicator's call function are considered _variables_ and which are _parameters_. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The `nvar` indicator integer attribute sets the number of arguments that are sent to the `datacheck` and `cfcheck` methods (in the signature's order).\n",
    "- The annotations of the underlying indice (the `compute` method). Arguments annotated with the `xarray.DataArray` type are considered _variables_ and can be read from the dataset passed in `ds`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indicator creation\n",
    "\n",
    "There a two ways for creating indicators:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) By initializing an existing indicator (sub)class\n",
    "2) From a dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "The first method is best when defining indicators in scripts of external modules and are explained here. The second is best used when building virtual modules through YAML files, and is explained further down and in the [submodule doc](../api.rst#module-xclim.core.indicator).\n",
