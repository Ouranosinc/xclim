    "xclim tries to make it easy for users to add their own indices and indicators. The following goes into details on how to create _indices_ and document them so that xclim can parse most of the metadata directly. We then explain the multiple ways new _Indicators_ can be created and, finally, how we can regroup and structure them in virtual submodules.\n",

    " - Returns one or several DataArrays. \n",
    " - Handles the units : checks input units and set proper CF-compliant output units. But doesn't usually prescribe specific units, the output will at minimum have the proper dimensionality.\n",
    " - Performs **no** other checks or set any (non-unit) metadata.\n",
    " - Accessible through [xclim.indices](../indices.rst).\n",
    " \n",
    "### indicator\n",
    "\n",
    " - An instance of a subclass of `xclim.core.indicator.Indicator` that wraps around an `indice` (stored in its `compute` property). \n",
    " - Returns one or several DataArrays.\n",
    " - Handles missing values, performs input data and metadata checks (see [usage](usage.ipynb#Health-checks-and-metadata-attributes)).\n",
    " - Always ouputs data in the same units.\n",
    " - Adds dynamically generated metadata to the output after computation.\n",
    " - Accessible through [xclim.indicators ](../indicators_api.rst)\n",

    "### Generic functions for common operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The [xclim.indices.generic](../indices.rst#generic-indices-submodule) submodule contains useful functions for common computations (like `threshold_count` or `select_resample_op`) and many basic indice functions, as defined by [clix-meta](https://github.com/clix-meta/clix-meta). In order to reduce duplicate code, their use is recommended for xclim's indices. As previously said, the units handling has to be made explicitly when non trivial, [xclim.core.units](../api.rst#module-xclim.core.units) also exposes a few helpers for that (like `convert_units_to`, `to_agg_units` or `rate2amount`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining new indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "xclim's Indicators are instances of (subclasses of) `xclim.core.indicator.Indicator`. While they are the central to xclim, their construction can be somewhat tricky as a lot happens backstage. Essentially, they act as self-aware functions, taking a set of input variables (DataArrays) and parameters (usually strings, integers or floats), performing some health checks on them and returning one or multiple DataArrays, with CF-compliant (and potentially translated) metadata attributes, masked according to a given missing value set of rules.\n",
    "They define the following key attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the `identifier`, as string that uniquely identifies the indicator,\n",
    "- the `realm`, one of \"atmos\", \"land\", \"seaIce\" or \"ocean\", classifying the domain of use of the indicator.\n",
    "- the `compute` function that returns one or more DataArrays, the \"indice\",\n",
    "- the `cfcheck` and `datacheck` methods that make sure the inputs are appropriate and valid.\n",
    "- the `missing` function that masks elements based on null values in the input.\n",
    "- all metadata attributes that will be attributed to the output and that document the indicator:\n",
    "    - Indicator-level attribute are : `title`, `abstract`, `keywords`, `references` and `notes`.\n",
    "    - Ouput variables attributes (respecting CF conventions) are: `var_name`, `standard_name`, `long_name`, `units`, `cell_methods`, `description` and `comment`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Output variables attributes are regrouped in `Indicator.cf_attrs` and input parameters are documented in `Indicator.parameters`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particularity of Indicators is that each instance corresponds to a single class: when creating a new indicator, a new class is automatically created. This is done for easy construction of indicators based on others, like shown further down.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [class documentation](../api.rst#module-xclim.core.indicator) for more info on the meaning of each attribute. The [indicators](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/tree/master/xclim/indicators) module contains over 50 examples of indicators to draw inspiration from.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metadata parsing vs explicit setting\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained above, most metadata can be parsed from the indice's signature and docstring. Otherwise, it can always be set when creating a new Indicator instance *or* a new subclass. When _creating_ an indicator, output metadata attributes can be given as strings, or list of strings in the case of indicator returning multiple outputs. However, they are stored in the `cf_attrs` list of dictionaries on the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Internationalization of metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "xclim offers the possibility to translate the main Indicator metadata field and automatically add the translations to the outputs. The mechnanic is explained in the [Internationalization](../internationalization.rst) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs and checks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways that xclim uses to decide which input arguments of the indicator's call function are considered _variables_ and which are _parameters_. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The `nvar` indicator integer attribute sets the number of arguments that are sent to the `datacheck` and `cfcheck` methods (in the signature's order).\n",
    "- The annotations of the underlying indice (the `compute` method). Arguments annotated with the `xarray.DataArray` type are considered _variables_ and can be read from the dataset passed in `ds`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indicator creation\n",
    "\n",
    "There a two and a half ways for creating indicators:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1) By initializing an existing indicator (sub)class\n",
    "- 1B) Subclassing an existing indicator and then initializing it.\n",
    "- 2) From a dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "The two first methods are best when defining indicators in scripts of external modules and are explained here. Number 2 is best used when building virtual modules through YAML files, and is explained further down and in the [submodule doc](../api.rst#module-xclim.core.indicator).\n",
