    "# Calculating Indices with *xclim*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`xclim` is built on very powerful multiprocessing and distributed computation libraries, notably `xarray` and `dask`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`xarray` is a python package making it easy to work with n-dimensional arrays. It labels axes with their names `[time, lat, lon, level]` instead of indices `[0,1,2,3]`, reducing the likelihood of bugs and making the code easier to understand. One of the key strengths of `xarray` is that it knows how to deal with non-standard calendars (we're looking at you, \"`360_days`\") and can easily resample daily time series to weekly, monthly, seasonal or annual periods.  Finally, `xarray` is tightly inegrated with `dask`, a package that can automatically parallelize operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are a few examples to consult when using `xclim` to subset netCDF arrays and compute climate indicators, taking advantage of the parallel processing capabilities offered by `xarray` and `dask`. For more information about these projects, please see their documentation pages:\n",

    "`xclim` unit handling also applies to threshold indicators. Users can provide threshold in units of choice and `xclim` will adjust automatically. For example determining the number of days with tasmax > 20°C users can define a threshold input of '20 C' or '20 degC' even if input data is in Kelvin. Alernatively users can even provide a threshold in Kelvin '293.15 K' (if they really wanted to)."
