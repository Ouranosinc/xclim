    "`xarray` is a python package making it easy to work with n-dimensional arrays. It labels axes with their names `[time, lat, lon, level]` instead of indices `[0,1,2,3]`, reducing the likelihood of bugs and making the code easier to understand. One of the key strengths of `xarray` is that it knows how to deal with non-standard calendars (we're looking at you, \"`360_days`\") and can easily resample daily time series to weekly, monthly, seasonal or annual periods.  Finally, `xarray` is tightly integrated with `dask`, a package that can automatically parallelize operations.\n",

The bottom layer is composed of a list of functions that take one or more `xarray.DataArray`'s as input and return an `xarray.DataArray` as output. You'll find these functions in `xclim.indices`. The indicator's logic is contained in this function, as well as some unit handling, but it doesn't perform any data consistency checks (like if the time frequency is daily), and doesn't adjust the metadata of the output array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second layer are class instances that you'll find organized by *realm*. So far, there are three realms available in `xclim.atmos`, `xclim.seaIce` and `xclim.land`, the first one being the most exhaustive. Before running computations, these classes check if the input data is a daily average of the expected variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If an indicator expects a daily mean, and you pass it a daily max, a `warning` will be raised.\n",
    "2. After the computation, it also checks the number of values per period to make sure there are not missing values or `NaN` in the input data. If there are, the output is going to be set to `NaN`.  Ex. : If the indicator performs a yearly resampling, but there are only 350 non-`NaN` values in one given year in the input data, that year's output will be `NaN`.\n",
    "3. The output units are set correctly as well as other properties of the output array, complying as much as possible with CF conventions.\n",

    "Almost all `xclim` indicators convert daily data to lower time frequencies, such as seasonal or annual values. This is done using `xarray.DataArray.resample` method.

    "`xclim` unit handling also applies to threshold indicators. Users can provide threshold in units of choice and `xclim` will adjust automatically. For example, determining the number of days with tasmax > 20 °C, users can define a threshold input of ``\"20 C\"`` or ``\"20 degC\"`` even if input data is in Kelvin. Alternatively, users can even provide a threshold in Kelvin (``\"293.15 K\"``, if they really wanted to)."
