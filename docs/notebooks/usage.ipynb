    "`xclim` is a library of climate indicators that operate on [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/) `DataArray` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "`xclim` provides two layers of computations, one responsible for computations and units handling (the computation layer, the **indices**), and the other responsible for input health checks and metadata formatting (the CF layer, referring to the Climate and Forecast convention, the **indicators**). Functions from the computation layer are found in `xclim.indices`, while indicator objects from the CF layer are found in *realm* modules (`xclim.atmos`, `xclim.land` and `xclim.seaIce`). Users should always use the indicators, and maybe revert to indices as a last resort if the indicator machinery becomes too heavy for their special edge case.\n",

    "\n",
    "`growing_degree_days` makes most sense with **daily input**, but could theoretically accept other source frequencies. The computational layer (*`Index`*) assumes that users have checked that the input data has the expected temporal frequency and has no missing values. However, no checks are performed, so the output data could be wrong (which is why it's always safer to use **`Indicator`** objects from the CF layer, as demonstrated in the following section).\n",

    "Finally, as almost all indices, the function takes a `freq` argument to specify over what time period it is computed. These are called \"Offset Aliases\" and are the same as the resampling string arguments. Valid arguments are detailed in [pandas docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases) (note that aliases involving \"business\" notions are not supported by `xarray` and thus could raise issues in xclim.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Units Handling paradigm\n",
    "\n",
    "Indices are written in order to be flexible as to the sampling frequency and units of the data. You _can_ use `growing_degree_days` on, for example, the 6-hourly data, but the output will then be in degree-hour units (``\"K h\"``). Moreover, all units, even when untouched by the calculation, will be reformatted into a CF-compliant symbol format. This behaviour was chosen to ensure consistency between all indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Very few indices will convert their output to specific units; Rather, it is the dimensionality that will be consistent on output. The [Units Handling](units.ipynb) page goes more into detail on how unit conversion can easily be done.\n",
