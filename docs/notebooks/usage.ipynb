    "The `growing_degree_days` *indice* function **expects daily input**, which is why we resampled it before. The computational layer assumes that users have checked that the input data has the expected temporal frequency and has no missing values, no checks are performed, so the ouput data could be wrong. If you're unsure about all those things, a safer bet is to use `Indicator` objects from the CF layer. Resampling is explained in [xarray's](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/time-series.html#resampling-and-grouped-operations) and [pandas'](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/timeseries.html#resampling) documentation on the subject.\n",
