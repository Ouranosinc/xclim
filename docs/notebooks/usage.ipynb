Functions from the computation layer are found in `xclim.indices`, while indicator objects from the CF layer are found in *realm* modules (`xclim.atmos`, `xclim.land` and `xclim.seaIce`). \n",

The computational layer assumes that users have checked that the input data has the expected temporal frequency and has no missing values.

    "As of xclim 0.24, the paradigm in unit handling has changed slightly. Now, indices are written in order to be more flexible as to the sampling frequency and units of the data. You _can_ use `growing_degree_days` on, for example, the 6-hourly data. The ouput will then be in degree-hour units (`K h`). Moreover, all units, even when untouched by the calculation, will be reformatted to a CF-compliant symbol format. This was made to ensure consistency between all indices.\n",
