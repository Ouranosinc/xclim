    "`xclim` is a library of climate indicators that operate on [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/) `DataArray` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "`xclim` provides two layers of computations, one responsible for computations and units handling (the computation layer, the **indices**), and the other responsible for input health checks and metadata formatting (the CF layer, referring to the Climate and Forecast convention, the **indicators**). Functions from the computation layer are found in `xclim.indices`, while indicator objects from the CF layer are found in *realm* modules (`xclim.atmos`, `xclim.land` and `xclim.seaIce`). Users should always use the indicators, and maybe revert to indices as a last resort if the indicator machinery becomes too heavy for their special edge case.\n",

    "The call to `xclim.indices.growing_degree_days` first checked that the input variable units were units of temperature, ran the computation, then set the output's units to the appropriate unit (here ``\"K d\"`` or Kelvin days). As you can see, the **Indicator** returned the same output, but with more metadata, it also performed more checks as explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "`growing_degree_days` makes most sense with **daily input**, but could theoretically accept other source frequencies. The computational layer (*`Index`*) assumes that users have checked that the input data has the expected temporal frequency and has no missing values. However, no checks are performed, so the output data could be wrong (which is why it's always safer to use **`Indicator`** objects from the CF layer, as demonstrated in the following section).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as almost all indices, the function takes a `freq` argument to specify over what time period it is computed. These are called \"Offset Aliases\" and are the same as the resampling string arguments. Valid arguments are detailed in [pandas docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases) (note that aliases involving \"business\" notions are not supported by `xarray` and thus could raise issues in xclim.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Units Handling paradigm\n",
    "\n",
    "Indices are written in order to be flexible as to the sampling frequency and units of the data. You _can_ use `growing_degree_days` on, for example, the 6-hourly data, but the output will then be in degree-hour units (``\"K h\"``). Moreover, all units, even when untouched by the calculation, will be reformatted into a CF-compliant symbol format. This behaviour was chosen to ensure consistency between all indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Very few indices will convert their output to specific units; Rather, it is the dimensionality that will be consistent on output. The [Units Handling](units.ipynb) page goes more into detail on how unit conversion can easily be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn't apply to **`Indicators`**. Those will always output data in a specific unit, the one listed in the `Indicators.cf_attrs` metadata dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have noticed, the `growing_degree_days` function above was not told along which dimension to operate. In xclim, the temporal dimension is _always_ assumed to be named `\"time\"`. All functions which reduce or compute over that dimension will expect that name. If you ever have another name in your data, you can simply rename it like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ds = ds.rename(T=\"time\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For other names and attributes, xclim tries to follow different sets of conventions. In particular, input data should follow the [CF conventions](http://cfconventions.org/) whenever possible for variable attributes. Variable names are usually the ones used in [CMIP6](https://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/mipVars.html), when they exist."

Some indicators will simply select the time period and run the calculations, while others will smartly perform the selection at the right time, when the order of operation makes a difference.
