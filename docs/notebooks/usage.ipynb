    "\n",
    "`xclim` is a library of climate indicators that operate on [xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org/) `DataArray` objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "`xclim` provides two layers of computations, one responsible for computations and units handling (the computation layer, the **indices**), and the other responsible for input health checks and metadata formatting (the CF layer, refering to the Climate and Forecast convention, the **indicators**). Functions from the computation layer are found in `xclim.indices`, while indicator objects from the CF layer are found in *realm* modules (`xclim.atmos`, `xclim.land` and `xclim.seaIce`). Users should always use the indicators, and maybe revert to indices as a last resort if the indicator machinery becomes too heavy for their special edge case.\n",

You _can_ use `growing_degree_days` on, for example, the 6-hourly data. The ouput will then be in degree-hour units (`K h`). Moreover, all units, even when untouched by the calculation, will be reformatted to a CF-compliant symbol format. This was made to ensure consistency between all indices.\n",
