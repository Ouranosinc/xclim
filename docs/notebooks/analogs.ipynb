    "Spatial analogues are maps showing which areas have a present-day climate that is analogous to the future climate of a given place. This type of map can be useful for climate adaptation to see how well regions are coping today under specific climate conditions. For example, officials from a city located in a temperate region that may be expecting more heatwaves in the future can learn from the experience of another city where heatwaves are a common occurrence, leading to more proactive intervention plans to better deal with new climate conditions.\n",

Some authors have found that in some cases, a second bias-adjustment over the indices is needed to ensure that the data passes this test (see [Grenier et al. (2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405880719300639)). However, in this introductory notebook, we can't run this test and will simply assume the data is coherent."
