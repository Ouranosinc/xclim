    "`xclim` provides tools and utilities to ease the bias-adjustment process through its `xclim.sdba` module. Almost all adjustment algorithms conform to the `train` - `adjust` scheme, formalized within `TrainAdjust` classes. Given a reference time series (ref), historical simulations (hist) and simulations to be adjusted (sim), any bias-adjustment method would be applied by first estimating the adjustment factors between the historical simulation and the observation series, and then applying these factors to `sim`, which could be a future simulation.\n",

    "## Modular approach\n",

    "The `sdba` module adopts a modular approach instead of implementing published and named methods directly.\n",

    "- preprocessing on `ref`, `hist` and `sim` (using methods in `xclim.sdba.processing` or `xclim.sdba.detrending`)\n",
    "- creating and training the adjustment object `Adj = Adjustment.train(obs, hist, **kwargs)` (from `xclim.sdba.adjustment`)\n",
    "- adjustment `scen = Adj.adjust(sim, **kwargs)`\n",
    "- post-processing on `scen` (for example: re-trending)\n",
    "\n",
    "The train-adjust approach allows us to inspect the trained adjustment object. The training information is stored in the underlying `Adj.ds` dataset and often has a `af` variable with the adjustment factors. Its layout and the other available variables vary between the different algorithm, refer to their part of the API docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For heavy processing, this separation allows the computation and writing to disk of the training dataset before performing the adjustment(s). See the [advanced notebook](sdba-advanced.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters needed by the training and the adjustment are saved to the `Adj.ds` dataset as a  `adj_params` attribute. For other parameters, those only needed by the adjustment are passed in the `adjust` call and written to the history attribute in the output scenario DataArray.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First example : pr and frequency adaptation\n",
    "\n",
    "The next example generates fake precipitation data and adjusts the `sim` timeseries, but also adds a step where the dry-day frequency of `hist` is adapted so that it fits that of `ref`. This ensures well-behaved adjustment factors for the smaller quantiles. Note also that we are passing `kind='*'` to use the multiplicative mode. Adjustment factors will be multiplied/divided instead of being added/subtracted."

However, `DetrendedQuantileMapping` normalizes over a `time.dayofyear` group, regardless of what is passed in the  `group` argument.

This is because we're using the (by default) `transform = 'max_distance'` argument.

Precipitation values would then be spread around at very low cost and have virtually no effect on the result. See this in action with `transform = None`.\n",
