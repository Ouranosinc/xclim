Given a reference time series (ref), historical simulations (hist) and simulations to be adjusted (sim), any bias-adjustment method would be applied by first estimating the adjustment factors between the historical simulation and the observations series, and then applying these factors to `sim`, which could be a future simulation.\n",

    "In the previous example, a simple Quantile Mapping algorithm was used with 15 quantiles and one group of values. The model performs well, but our toy data is also quite smooth and well-behaved so this is not surprising. A more complex example could have biais distribution varying strongly across months. To perform the adjustment with different factors for each months, one can pass `group='time.month'`. Moreover, to reduce the risk of sharp change in the adjustment at the interface of the months, `interp='linear'` can be passed to `adjust` and the adjustment factors will be interpolated linearly. Ex: the factors for the 1st of May will be the average of those for april and those for may. This option is currently only implemented for monthly grouping."

Using small groupings (like `time.dayofyear`) adds precision and robustness, but also decuplates the load and computing complexity. A good first read on this are xarray's [Optimization tips](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/dask.html#optimization-tips).\n",

    "\n",
    "* When saving a file with `to_netcdf`, setting option `unlimited_dims` with a list of dimension names can force xarray to write the data using chunks on disk, instead of one contiguous array. Command-line tool `ncdump -sh` can give information on how those chunks are oriented on disk and the optimal `chunks={...}` choice can be inferred.\n",
    "* Most adjustment method will need to perform operation on the whole `time` coordinate, so it is best to optimize chunking along the other dimensions.\n",
    "* One of the main bottleneck for adjustments with small groups is that dask needs to build and optimize an enormous task graph. In order to ease that process and reduce the number of recalculations, given that the training dataset fits in memory, one could call `Adjustment.ds.load()` to trigger the computation and store the result as a `np.array`. For very large tasks, one could write the training dataset to disk and then reload them into the `Adjustment` object.\n",
    "* Consider using `engine=\"h5netcdf\"` in `open_[mf]dataset` when possible. Compatibility of a file can be found using the `is_hdf5()` method of the `h5py` module."
