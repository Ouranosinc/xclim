    "`xarray` is a python package making it easy to work with n-dimensional arrays. It labels axes with their names (time, lat, lon, level) instead of indices (0,1,2,3), reducing the likelihood of bugs and making the code easier to understand. One of the key strengths of `xarray` is that it knows how to deal with non-standard calendars (I'm looking at you 360_days) and can easily resample daily time series to weekly, monthly, seasonal or annual periods.  Finally, `xarray` is tightly inegrated with `dask`, a package that can automatically parallelize operations.\n"
