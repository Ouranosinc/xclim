	abstract = {This study concerns firstly the methodology to describe the climate of vineyards, on a macroclimate scale of viticultural regions worldwide. Three synthetic and complementary viticultural climatic indices (potential water balance of the soil over the growing cycle, heliothermal conditions over the growing cycle and night temperature during maturation), validated as descriptors, are used: (1) dryness index (DI) which corresponds to the potential water balance of the soil of Riou’s index, here adapted using precise conditions to calculate it, as an indicator of the level of presence-absence of dryness; (2) heliothermal index (HI) which corresponds to Huglin’s heliothermal index; (3) cool night index (CI) an index developed as an indicator of night temperature conditions during maturation. These indices are representative of the variability of the viticultural climate worldwide, related to the requirements of varieties, vintage quality (sugar, colour, aroma), and typeness of the wines. A Multicriteria Climatic Classification System (Géoviticulture MCC System) for the grape-growing regions worldwide is formulated based on classes for each of the three climate indices, with elements to explain the results. Three formulated concepts provide the system base: viticultural climate, climatic group and viticultural climate with intra-annual variability (for warm regions with more than one harvest a year in natural climate conditions). The application of the Géoviticulture Multicriteria Climatic Classification System is presented for 97 grape-growing regions in 29 countries. The system is a research tool for grape-growing and wine-making zoning. It also enables work at different levels on the scale, on a world-wide scale or larger – the large grape-growing region, the small grape-growing region, as shown by the studies performed. It allows relating the viticultural climate to the elements of grape quality and the typeness of the wines considering the climatic zone.},

	abstract = {A district's grape-ripening capacity has previously been related to the area's growing degree days (DD) or the mean temperature of the warmest month (MTWM). It has been observed that grape cultivars ripened in parts of New Zealand where they did not fulfill the DD or MTWM criteria used for Europe or North America; thus, an attempt was made to find a more universal index. Cultivars were divided into four distinct groups, based on their ripening requirements, and 14 indices were tested for their ability to relate the groups to the districts in which they are known to ripen. Seventy-eight locations in Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand were used. Three groups of locations were adequately separated using DD or MTWM and a different three by latitude. All groups were separated, by an index combining latitude and MTWM. This is termed the latitude-temperature index (LTI) and has more general usefulness for all areas than any other index tested. LTI = MTWM (60 - latitude).},

	abstract = {Background and Aims: Temperature-based indices are commonly used to indicate long-term suitability of climate for commercially viable winegrape production of different grapevine cultivars, but their calculation has been inconsistent and often inconsiderate of within-region spatial variability. This paper (i) investigates and quantifies differences between four such indices; and (ii) quantifies the within-region spatial variability for each Australian wine region. Methods and Results: Four commonly used indices describing winegrape growing suitability were calculated for each Australian geographic indication (GI) using temperature data from 1971 to 2000. Within-region spatial variability was determined for each index using a geographic information system. The sets of indices were compared with each other using first- and second-order polynomial regression. Heat-sum temperature indices were strongly related to the simple measure of mean growing season temperature, but variation resulted in some differences between indices. Conclusion: Temperature regime differences between the same region pairs varied depending upon which index was employed. Spatial variability of the climate indices within some regions led to significant overlap with other regions; knowledge of the climate distribution provides a better understanding of the range of cultivar suitability within each region. Significance of the Study: Within-region spatial variability and the use of different indices over inconsistent time periods to describe temperature regimes have, before now, made comparisons of climates between viticulture regions difficult. Consistent calculations of indices, and quantification of spatial variability, enabled comparisons of Australian GIs to be made both within Australia and with American Viticultural Areas in the western United States.},

The indices are categorized for three crop types: cool season, warm season, and overwintering. Results indicate a significant lengthening of the growing season due to a significantly earlier start and a significantly later end of the growing season. Significant positive trends are also observed for effective growing degree-days and crop heat units at most locations across the country. The occurrence of extremely low temperatures has become less frequent during the nongrowing season, implying a more favorable climate for overwinter survival. In addition, the total numbers of cool days, frost days, and killing-frost days within a growing season have a decreasing trend. This means that crops may also be less vulnerable to cold stress and injury during the growing season. Extreme daily precipitation amounts and 10-day precipitation totals during the growing season have been increasing. Significant trends associated with increased availability of water during the growing season are identified by the standardized precipitation index and seasonal water deficits. The benefit of the increased precipitation may have been offset by an upward trend in evaporative demand; however, this would depend on the amount of growth and productivity resulting from increased actual evapotranspiration.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Agroclimatic indices (heat units and water deficits) were determined for the Atlantic region of Canada for a baseline climate (1961 to 1990 period) and for two future time periods (2010 to 2039 and 2040 to 2069). Climate scenarios for the future periods were primarily based on outputs from the Canadian General Circulation Model (GCM) that included the effects of aerosols (CGCMI-A), but variability introduced by multiple GCM experiments was also examined. Climatic data for all three periods were interpolated to a grid of about 10 to 15 km. Agroclimatic indices were computed and mapped based on the gridded data. Based on CGCMI-A scenarios interpolated to the fine grid, average crop heat units (CHU) would increase by 300 to 500 CHU for the 2010 to 2039 period and by 500 to 700 CHU for the 2040 to 2069 period in the main agricultural areas of the Atlantic region. However, increases in CHU for the 2040 to 2069 period typically varied from 450 to 1650 units in these regions when variability among GCM experiments was considered, resulting in a projected range of 2650 to 4000 available CHU. Effective growing degree-days above 5°C (EGDD) typically increased by about 400 units for the 2040 to 2069 period in the main agricultural areas, resulting in available EGDD from 1800 to over 2000 units. Uncertainty introduced by multiple GCMs increased the range from 1700 to 2700 EGDD. A decrease in heat units (cooling) is anticipated along part of the coast of Labrador. Anticipated changes in water deficits (DEFICIT), defined as the amount by which potential evapotranspiration exceeded precipitation over the growing season, typically ranged from +50 to –50 mm for both periods, but this range widened from +50 to –100 mm when variability among GCM experiments was considered. The greatest increases in deficits were expected in the central region of New Brunswick for the 2040 to 2069 period. Our interpolation procedures estimated mean winter and summer temperature changes that were 1.4°C on average lower than a statistical downscaling procedure (SDSM) for four locations. Increases in precipitation during summer and autumn averaged 20\% less than SDSM. During periods when SDSM estimated relatively small changes in temperature or precipitation, our interpolation procedure tended to produce changes that were larger than SDSM. Additional investigations would be beneficial that explore the impact of a range of scenarios from other GCM models, other downscaling methods and the potential effects of change in climate variability on these agroclimatic indices. Potential impacts of these changes on crop yields and production in the region also need to be explored.},

A sensitivity analysis, using arbitrary adjustments to temperature, suggested that even a 1°C warming could lead to a significant expansion in potential of viticulture. More critical examination, using GCM projections of global warming, and more site or region specific studies are recommended.},

	abstract = {Public health planning needs the support of evidence-based information on current and future climate, which could be used by health professionals and decision makers to better understand and respond to the health impacts of extreme heat. Climate models provide information regarding the expected increase in temperatures and extreme heat events with climate change and can help predict the severity of future health impacts, which can be used in the public health sector for the development of adaptation strategies to reduce heat-related morbidity and mortality. This study analyzes the evolution of extreme temperature indices specifically defined to characterize heat events associated with health risks, in the context of a changing climate. The analysis is performed by using temperature projections from the Canadian Regional Climate Model. A quantile-based statistical correction is applied to the projected temperatures, in order to reduce model biases and account for the representativeness error. Moreover, generalized Pareto distributions are used to extend the temperature distribution upper tails and extrapolate the statistical correction to extremes that are not observed in the present but that might occur in the future. The largest increase in extreme daytime temperatures occurs in southern Manitoba, Canada, where the already overly dry climate and lack of soil moisture can lead to an uncontrolled enhancement of hot extremes. The occurrence of warm nights and heat waves, on the other hand, is already large and will increase substantially in the communities of the Great Lakes region, characterized by a humid climate. Impact and adaptation studies need to account for the temperature variability due to local effects, since it can be considerably larger than the model natural variability.},

Energy distance is zero if and only if the distributions are identical, thus it characterizes equality of distributions and provides a theoretical foundation for statistical inference and analysis. Energy statistics are functions of distances between observations in metric spaces. As a statistic, energy distance can be applied to measure the difference between a sample and a hypothesized distribution or the difference between two or more samples in arbitrary, not necessarily equal dimensions. The name energy is inspired by the close analogy with Newton's gravitational potential energy. Applications include testing independence by distance covariance, goodness-of-fit, nonparametric tests for equality of distributions and extension of analysis of variance, generalizations of clustering algorithms, change point analysis, feature selection, and more.

The proposed test is universally consistent against all fixed alternatives (not necessarily continuous) with finite second moments. The test is implemented by conditioning on the pooled sample to obtain an approximate permutation test, which is distribution free. Our Monte Carlo power study suggests that the new test may be much more sensitive than tests based on nearest neighbors against several classes of alternatives, and performs particularly well in high dimension. Computational complexity of our test procedure is independent of dimension and number of populations sampled.

Many had felt that the old formula for equivalent temperature, derived in the 1960s from Siple and Passel's flawed but quite useful Wind Chill Index, unnecessarily exaggerated the severity of the weather. The new formula is based on a mathematical model of heat flow from the upwind side of a head-sized cylinder moving at walking speed into the wind. The paper details the assumptions that were made in generating the new wind chill charts. It also points out weaknesses in the concept of wind chill equivalent temperature, including its steady-state character and a seemingly paradoxical effect of the internal thermal resistance of the cylinder on comfort and equivalent temperature.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Potential evapotranspiration (PET) is a necessary input data for most hydrological models and is often needed at a daily time step. An accurate estimation of PET requires many input climate variables which are, in most cases, not available prior to the 1960s for the UK, nor indeed most parts of the world. Therefore, when applying hydrological models to earlier periods, modellers have to rely on PET estimations derived from simplified methods. Given that only monthly observed temperature data is readily available for the late 19th and early 20th century at a national scale for the UK, the objective of this work was to derive the best possible UK-wide gridded PET dataset from the limited data available.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}To that end, firstly, a combination of (i) seven temperature-based PET equations, (ii) four different calibration approaches and (iii) seven input temperature data were evaluated. For this evaluation, a gridded daily PET product based on the physically based Penman–Monteith equation (the CHESS PET dataset) was used, the rationale being that this provides a reliable “ground truth” PET dataset for evaluation purposes, given that no directly observed, distributed PET datasets exist. The performance of the models was also compared to a “naïve method”, which is defined as the simplest possible estimation of PET in the absence of any available climate data. The “naïve method” used in this study is the CHESS PET daily long-term average (the period from 1961 to 1990 was chosen), or CHESS-PET daily climatology.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The analysis revealed that the type of calibration and the input temperature dataset had only a minor effect on the accuracy of the PET estimations at catchment scale. From the seven equations tested, only the calibrated version of the McGuinness–Bordne equation was able to outperform the “naïve method” and was therefore used to derive the gridded, reconstructed dataset. The equation was calibrated using 43 catchments across Great Britain.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The dataset produced is a 5\&thinsp;km gridded PET dataset for the period 1891 to 2015, using the Met Office 5\&thinsp;km monthly gridded temperature data available for that time period as input data for the PET equation.

	abstract = {The assessment of the thermal environment is one ofthe main issues in bioclimatic research, and more than 100 simple bioclimatic indices have thus far been developed to facilitate it. However, most of these indices have proved to be of limited applicability, and do not portroy the actual impacts of thermal conditions on human beings. Indices derived from human heatbalance models (one- or two-node) have been found to offer a better representation of the environmental impact in question than do simple ones. Indeed, the new generation of multi-node models for human heat balance do allow full account to be taken of heat transfer and exchange, both within the human body and between the body surface and the surrounding air layer. In this paper, it is essential background information regarding the newly-developed Universal Thermal Climate Index UTCI that is presented, this in fact deriving from the Fiala multi-node model of human heatbalance. The UTCI is defined as the air temperature (Ta) of the reference condition causing the same model response as actual conditions. UTCI was developed in 2009 by virtue of international co-operation between leading experts in the areas of human thermophysiology, physiological modelling, meteorology and climatology. The necessary research for this had been conducted within the framework of a special commission of the International Society of Biometeorology (ISB) and European COST Action 730.},

However, most applications of WBGT within the heat stress impact literature that do not use WBGT at all, but use one of the ad hoc approximations, typically the simplified WBGT (sWBGT) or the environmental stress index (ESI). Surprisingly, little is known about how well these approximations work for the global climate and climate change settings that they are being applied to. Here, we assess the bias distribution as a function of temperature, humidity, wind speed, and radiative conditions of both sWBGT and ESI relative to a well-validated, explicit physical model for WBGT developed by Liljegren, within an idealized context and the more realistic setting of ERA5 reanalysis data. sWBGT greatly overestimates heat stress in hot-humid areas. ESI has much smaller biases in the range of standard climatological conditions. Over subtropical dry regions, both metrics can substantially underestimate extreme heat. We show systematic overestimation of labor loss by sWBGT over much of the world today. We recommend discontinuing the use of sWBGT. ESI may be acceptable for assessing average heat stress or integrated impact over a long period like a year, but less suitable for health applications, extreme heat stress analysis, or as an operational index for heat warning, heatwave forecasting, or guiding activity modification at the workplace. Nevertheless, Liljegren's approach should be preferred over these ad hoc approximations and we provide a fast Python implementation to encourage its widespread use.},

The proposed framework requires as input radiation fluxes computed by numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and generates as output gridded globe-wide maps of MRT. It also considers changes in the Sun’s position affecting radiation components when these are stored by NWP models as an accumulated-over-time quantity. The applicability of the framework was demonstrated using NWP reanalysis radiation data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Mapped distributions of MRT were correspondingly computed at the global scale. Comparison against measurements from radiation monitoring stations showed a good agreement with NWP-based MRT (coefficient of determination greater than 0.88; average bias equal to 0.42 °C) suggesting its potential as a proxy for observations in application studies.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: The term flashiness reflects the frequency and rapidity of short term changes in streamflow, especially during runoff events. Flashiness is an important component of a stream's hydrologic regime. A variety of land use and land management changes may lead to increased or decreased flashiness, often to the detriment of aquatic life. This paper presents a newly developed flashiness index, which is based on mean daily flows. The index is calculated by dividing the pathlength of flow oscillations for a time interval (i.e., the sum of the absolute values of day-to-day changes in mean daily flow) by total discharge during that time interval. This index has low interannual variability, relative to most flow regime indicators, and thus greater power to detect trends. Index values were calculated for 515 Midwestern streams for the 27-year period from 1975 through 2001. Statistically significant increases were present in 22 percent of the streams, primarily in the eastern portion of the study area, while decreases were present in 9 percent, primarily in the western portion. Index values tend to decrease with increasing watershed area and with increasing unit area ground water inputs. Area compensated index values often shift at ecoregion boundaries. Potential index applications include evaluation of programs to restore more natural flow regimes.},

	abstract = {Abstract Heat waves are a major cause of weather-related deaths. With the current concern for global warming it is reasonable to suppose that they may increase in frequency, severity, duration, or areal extent in the future. However, in the absence of an adequate definition of a heat wave, it is impossible to assess either changes in the past or possible consequences for the future. A set of definitions is proposed here, based on the criteria for heat stress forecasts developed by the National Weather Service (NWS). Watches or warnings are issued when thresholds of daytime high and nighttime low heat index (Hi) values are exceeded for at least two consecutive days. The heat index is a combination of ambient temperature and humidity that approximates the environmental aspect of the thermal regime of a human body, with the NWS thresholds representing a generalized estimate of the onset of physiological stress. These thresholds cannot be applied directly nationwide. In hot and humid regions, physical, social, and cultural adaptations will require that the thresholds be set higher to ensure that only those events perceived as stressful are identified. In other, cooler, areas the NWS criteria may never be reached even though unusually hot events may be perceived as heat waves. Thus, it is likely that a similar number of perceived heat events will occur in all regions, with the thresholds varying regionally. Hourly Hi for 178 stations in the coterminous United States was analyzed for the 1951–90 period to determine appropriate threshold criteria. Use of the NWS criteria alone indicated that much of the nation had less than three heat waves per decade, and this value was adopted as the baseline against which to establish suitable thresholds. For all areas, a percentile threshold approach was tested. Using all available data, daytime high and nighttime low thresholds were established separately for each specific percentile. Heat waves were treated as occurring when conditions exceeded both the daytime high and the nighttime low thresholds of the same percentile for two consecutive days. Several thresholds were tested. For much of the South, 1\% thresholds produced appropriate values. Consequently, a heat wave was defined as a period of at least 48 h during which neither the overnight low nor the daytime high Hi falls below the NWS heat stress thresholds (80° and 105°F, respectively), except at stations for which more than 1\% of both the annual high and low Hi observations exceed these thresholds, in which case the 1\% values are used as the heat wave thresholds. As an extension, “hot spells” were similarly defined, but for events falling between the 1\% values and NWS thresholds, with “warm spells” occurring between the 2\% and 1\% values. Again, stations for which the 1\% or 2\% Hi values exceed the NWS thresholds were given modified definitions. The preliminary investigation of the timing and location of heat waves resulting from these definitions indicated that they correctly identified major epidemiological events. A tentative climatic comparison also suggests that heat waves are becoming less frequent in the southern and more frequent in the midwestern and eastern parts of the nation.},

	abstract = {A suite of climate change indices derived from daily temperature and precipitation data, with a primary focus on extreme events, were computed and analyzed. By setting an exact formula for each index and using specially designed software, analyses done in different countries have been combined seamlessly. This has enabled the presentation of the most up-to-date and comprehensive global picture of trends in extreme temperature and precipitation indices using results from a number of workshops held in data-sparse regions and high-quality station data supplied by numerous scientists world wide. Seasonal and annual indices for the period 1951–2003 were gridded. Trends in the gridded fields were computed and tested for statistical significance. Results showed widespread significant changes in temperature extremes associated with warming, especially for those indices derived from daily minimum temperature. Over 70\% of the global land area sampled showed a significant decrease in the annual occurrence of cold nights and a significant increase in the annual occurrence of warm nights. Some regions experienced a more than doubling of these indices. This implies a positive shift in the distribution of daily minimum temperature throughout the globe. Daily maximum temperature indices showed similar changes but with smaller magnitudes. Precipitation changes showed a widespread and significant increase, but the changes are much less spatially coherent compared with temperature change. Probability distributions of indices derived from approximately 200 temperature and 600 precipitation stations, with near-complete data for 1901–2003 and covering a very large region of the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes (and parts of Australia for precipitation) were analyzed for the periods 1901–1950, 1951–1978 and 1979–2003. Results indicate a significant warming throughout the 20th century. Differences in temperature indices distributions are particularly pronounced between the most recent two periods and for those indices related to minimum temperature. An analysis of those indices for which seasonal time series are available shows that these changes occur for all seasons although they are generally least pronounced for September to November. Precipitation indices show a tendency toward wetter conditions throughout the 20th century.},

	abstract = {Much of the atmospheric variability in the North Atlantic sector is associated with variations in the eddy-driven component of the zonal flow. Here we present a simple method to specifically diagnose this component of the flow using the low-level wind field (925–700 hpa ). We focus on the North Atlantic winter season in the ERA-40 reanalysis. Diagnostics of the latitude and speed of the eddy-driven jet stream are compared with conventional diagnostics of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the East Atlantic (EA) pattern. This shows that the NAO and the EA both describe combined changes in the latitude and speed of the jet stream. It is therefore necessary, but not always sufficient, to consider both the NAO and the EA in identifying changes in the jet stream. The jet stream analysis suggests that there are three preferred latitudinal positions of the North Atlantic eddy-driven jet stream in winter. This result is in very good agreement with the application of a statistical mixture model to the two-dimensional state space defined by the NAO and the EA. These results are consistent with several other studies which identify four European/Atlantic regimes, comprising three jet stream patterns plus European blocking events.

	abstract = {Abstract Winter weather creates mobility challenges for most northern jurisdictions, leading to significant expenditures on winter road maintenance (WRM) activities. While the science and practice of snow and ice control is continually evolving, climate change presents particular challenges for the strategic planning of WRM. The purpose of this study is 1) to develop a winter severity index (WSI) to better understand how winter weather translates into interannual variations in WRM activities and 2) to apply the WSI to future climate change projections to assist a northern community in preparing for climate change. A new method for creating a WSI model is explored, using readily available data from maintenance records and meteorological stations. The WSI is created by optimizing values for three levels of snowfall as well as potential icing events and is shown to have high predictive accuracy for WRM (coefficient of determination R2 of 0.93). The WSI is then applied to historic and future climate data in a municipality located in central British Columbia, Canada. Findings reveal that much of the variability in WRM can be attributed to weather. The results of the climate change analysis show that winter precipitation in the region is expected to increase by 5.2\%–12.3\%, and winter average temperatures are projected to increase by 1.5°–2.8°C in the 2050s, compared to the 1976–2000 baseline based on 65 GCMs. Based on the midrange (25th to 75th percentiles) of the 65 GCM projections, annual demand for WRM activities is estimated to decrease by 13.0\%–22.0\%.},

Weather-dependent components or modules are calculated or computed for effective use of the system’s two main subsystems, the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System and the Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction (FBP) System. This weather guide includes detailed specifications for locating and instrumenting fire weather stations, taking weather observations, and overwintering the Drought Code component of the FWI System. The sensitivity of the FWI System components to weather elements is represented quantitatively. The importance of weather that is not directly observable is discussed in the context of fuel moisture and fire behavior. Current developments in the observation and measurement of fire weather and the forecasting of fire danger are discussed, along with the implications for the reporting of fire weather of increasingly automated fire management information systems.},

We have developed a global database of daily FWI System calculations, beginning in 1980, called the Global Fire WEather Database (GFWED) gridded to a spatial resolution of 0.5° latitude by 2/3° longitude. Input weather data were obtained from the NASA Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), and two different estimates of daily precipitation from rain gauges over land. FWI System Drought Code calculations from the gridded data sets were compared to calculations from individual weather station data for a representative set of 48 stations in North, Central and South America, Europe, Russia, Southeast Asia and Australia. Agreement between gridded calculations and the station-based calculations tended to be most different at low latitudes for strictly MERRA-based calculations. Strong biases could be seen in either direction: MERRA DC over the Mato Grosso in Brazil reached unrealistically high values exceeding DC = 1500 during the dry season but was too low over Southeast Asia during the dry season. These biases are consistent with those previously identified in MERRA's precipitation, and they reinforce the need to consider alternative sources of precipitation data. GFWED can be used for analyzing historical relationships between fire weather and fire activity at continental and global scales, in identifying large-scale atmosphere–ocean controls on fire weather, and calibration of FWI-based fire prediction models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Five different "drought" indexes are compared as to rate of moisture loss and gain, reservoir size, temperature effect, and whether presented on an absolute or comparative basis. The role of timelag in deciding whether the index should be computed continuously from one fire season to the next is tested. The purpose of the index will determine whether it should be presented in terms of the moisture content of some identifiable component of the fuel complex, or in some other form such as the content of a soil reservoir. Its role in fire danger rating is distinctly subsidiary, and not to be confused wi th the principal short-term indicators of fire ignition potential and rate of spread.},

ERA5 HRES represents an improved dataset compared to several other reanalyses in terms of accuracy, as well as spatial and temporal coverage. The FWI calculation is performed using two different procedures for setting the start-up value of the Drought Code (DC) at the beginning of the fire season. The first procedure, which accounts for the effects of inter-seasonal drought, overwinters the DC by adjusting the fall DC value with a fraction of accumulated overwinter precipitation. The second procedure sets the DC to its default start-up value (i.e. 15) at the start of each fire season. We validate the FWI values over Canada using station observations from Environment and Climate Change Canada and find generally good agreement (mean Spearman correlation of 0.77). We also show that significant differences in early season DC and FWI values can occur when the FWI System calculation is started using the overwintered versus default DC values, as is highlighted by an example from 2016 over North America.

The solar forcing is provided for radiative properties, namely total solar irradiance (TSI), solar spectral irradiance (SSI), and the F10.7 index as well as particle forcing, including geomagnetic indices Ap and Kp, and ionization rates to account for effects of solar protons, electrons, and galactic cosmic rays. This is the first time that a recommendation for solar-driven particle forcing has been provided for a CMIP exercise. The solar forcing datasets are provided at daily and monthly resolution separately for the CMIP6 preindustrial control, historical (1850–2014), and future (2015–2300) simulations. For the preindustrial control simulation, both constant and time-varying solar forcing components are provided, with the latter including variability on 11-year and shorter timescales but no long-term changes. For the future, we provide a realistic scenario of what solar behavior could be, as well as an additional extreme Maunder-minimum-like sensitivity scenario. This paper describes the forcing datasets and also provides detailed recommendations as to their implementation in current climate models.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}For the historical simulations, the TSI and SSI time series are defined as the average of two solar irradiance models that are adapted to CMIP6 needs: an empirical one (NRLTSI2–NRLSSI2) and a semi-empirical one (SATIRE). A new and lower TSI value is recommended: the contemporary solar-cycle average is now 1361.0 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$. The slight negative trend in TSI over the three most recent solar cycles in the CMIP6 dataset leads to only a small global radiative forcing of −0.04 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$. In the 200–400 nm wavelength range, which is important for ozone photochemistry, the CMIP6 solar forcing dataset shows a larger solar-cycle variability contribution to TSI than in CMIP5 (50 \% compared to 35 \%).{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}We compare the climatic effects of the CMIP6 solar forcing dataset to its CMIP5 predecessor by using time-slice experiments of two chemistry–climate models and a reference radiative transfer model. The differences in the long-term mean SSI in the CMIP6 dataset, compared to CMIP5, impact on climatological stratospheric conditions (lower shortwave heating rates of −0.35 K day$^{\textrm{−1}}$ at the stratopause), cooler stratospheric temperatures (−1.5 K in the upper stratosphere), lower ozone abundances in the lower stratosphere (−3 \%), and higher ozone abundances (+1.5 \% in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere). Between the maximum and minimum phases of the 11-year solar cycle, there is an increase in shortwave heating rates (+0.2 K day$^{\textrm{−1}}$ at the stratopause), temperatures ( ∼ 1 K at the stratopause), and ozone (+2.5 \% in the upper stratosphere) in the tropical upper stratosphere using the CMIP6 forcing dataset. This solar-cycle response is slightly larger, but not statistically significantly different from that for the CMIP5 forcing dataset.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}CMIP6 models with a well-resolved shortwave radiation scheme are encouraged to prescribe SSI changes and include solar-induced stratospheric ozone variations, in order to better represent solar climate variability compared to models that only prescribe TSI and/or exclude the solar-ozone response. We show that monthly-mean solar-induced ozone variations are implicitly included in the SPARC/CCMI CMIP6 Ozone Database for historical simulations, which is derived from transient chemistry–climate model simulations and has been developed for climate models that do not calculate ozone interactively. CMIP6 models without chemistry that perform a preindustrial control simulation with time-varying solar forcing will need to use a modified version of the SPARC/CCMI Ozone Database that includes solar variability. CMIP6 models with interactive chemistry are also encouraged to use the particle forcing datasets, which will allow the potential long-term effects of particles to be addressed for the first time. The consideration of particle forcing has been shown to significantly improve the representation of reactive nitrogen and ozone variability in the polar middle atmosphere, eventually resulting in further improvements in the representation of solar climate variability in global models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Most aspects of extreme modeling techniques are covered, including historical techniques (still widely used) and contemporary techniques based on point process models. A wide range of worked examples, using genuine datasets, illustrate the various modeling procedures and a concluding chapter provides a brief introduction to a number of more advanced topics, including Bayesian inference and spatial extremes. All the computations are carried out using S-PLUS, and the corresponding datasets and functions are available via the Internet for readers to recreate examples for themselves.

In the scenario experiment, the greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations are prescribed by the so-called SRES-A2 hypotheses, whereas the sea surface temperature and sea ice extent come from an earlier ocean–atmosphere coupled simulation. The model covers the whole globe, with a variable resolution reaching 50 to 60 km over France. Model responses on daily minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation are analyzed over France. The distribution of daily values is compared with observed data from the French climatological network. The extreme cold temperatures and summer heavy precipitations are underestimated by the model. A correction technique is proposed in order to adjust the simulated values according to the observed ones. This process is applied to both reference and scenario simulation. Synthetic indices of extreme events are calculated with corrected simulations. The number of heavy rain ({\textgreater}10 mm) days increases by one quarter in winter. The maximum length of summer dry episodes increases by one half in summer. The number of heat wave days is multiplied by 10. The response in precipitation is less when only the change in the mean is considered. Such a corrected simulation is useful to feed impact models which are sensitive to threshold values, but the correction does not reduce, and may enhance in some cases, the uncertainty about the climate projections. Using several models and scenarios is the appropriate technique to deal with uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Abstract Quantile mapping bias correction algorithms are commonly used to correct systematic distributional biases in precipitation outputs from climate models. Although they are effective at removing historical biases relative to observations, it has been found that quantile mapping can artificially corrupt future model-projected trends. Previous studies on the modification of precipitation trends by quantile mapping have focused on mean quantities, with less attention paid to extremes. This article investigates the extent to which quantile mapping algorithms modify global climate model (GCM) trends in mean precipitation and precipitation extremes indices. First, a bias correction algorithm, quantile delta mapping (QDM), that explicitly preserves relative changes in precipitation quantiles is presented. QDM is compared on synthetic data with detrended quantile mapping (DQM), which is designed to preserve trends in the mean, and with standard quantile mapping (QM). Next, methods are applied to phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) daily precipitation projections over Canada. Performance is assessed based on precipitation extremes indices and results from a generalized extreme value analysis applied to annual precipitation maxima. QM can inflate the magnitude of relative trends in precipitation extremes with respect to the raw GCM, often substantially, as compared to DQM and especially QDM. The degree of corruption in the GCM trends by QM is particularly large for changes in long period return values. By the 2080s, relative changes in excess of +500\% with respect to historical conditions are noted at some locations for 20-yr return values, with maximum changes by DQM and QDM nearing +240\% and +140\%, respectively, whereas raw GCM changes are never projected to exceed +120\%.},

	abstract = {A precipitation downscaling method is presented using precipitation from a general circulation model (GCM) as predictor. The method extends a previous method from monthly to daily temporal resolution. The simplest form of the method corrects for biases in wet-day frequency and intensity. A more sophisticated variant also takes account of flow-dependent biases in the GCM. The method is flexible and simple to implement. It is proposed here as a correction of GCM output for applications where sophisticated methods are not available, or as a benchmark for the evaluation of other downscaling methods. Applied to output from reanalyses (ECMWF, NCEP) in the region of the European Alps, the method is capable of reducing large biases in the precipitation frequency distribution, even for high quantiles. The two variants exhibit similar performances, but the ideal choice of method can depend on the GCM/reanalysis and it is recommended to test the methods in each case. Limitations of the method are found in small areas with unresolved topographic detail that influence higher-order statistics (e.g. high quantiles). When used as benchmark for three regional climate models (RCMs), the corrected reanalysis and the RCMs perform similarly in many regions, but the added value of the latter is evident for high quantiles in some small regions.

The standard approach is that the corrections are calibrated and applied separately for individual spatial points and meteorological variables. For this reason, the correlation and covariance structures of the observed and corrected data differ, although the individual observed and corrected data sets correspond well in their statistical indicators. This inconsistency may affect impact studies using corrected simulations. This study presents a new approach to the bias correction utilizing principal components in combination with quantile mapping, which allows for the correction of multivariate data sets. The proposed procedure significantly reduces the bias in covariance and correlation structures, as well as that in the distribution of individual variables. This is in contrast to standard quantile mapping, which only corrects the individual distributions, and leaves the dependence structure biased.},

	abstract = {Bias adjustment of numerical climate model simulations involves several arguments wherein the notion of physical inconsistency is referred to, either for rejecting the legitimacy of bias adjustment in general or for justifying the necessity of sophisticated multivariate techniques. However, this notion is often mishandled, in part because the literature generally proceeds without defining it. In this context, the central objective of this study is to clarify and illustrate the distinction between physical inconsistency and multivariate bias, by investigating the effect of bias adjustment on two different kinds of intervariable relationships, namely a physical constraint expected to hold at every step of a time series and statistical properties that emerge with potential bias over a climatic timescale. To this end, 18 alternative bias adjustment techniques are applied on 10 climate simulations at 12 sites over North America. Adjusted variables are temperature, pressure, relative humidity and specific humidity, linked by a thermodynamic constraint. The analysis suggests on the one hand that a clear instance of potential physical inconsistency can be avoided with either a univariate or a multivariate technique, if and only if the bias adjustment strategy explicitly considers the physical constraint to be preserved. On the other hand, it also suggests that sophisticated multivariate techniques alone are not complete adjustment strategies in presence of a physical constraint, as they cannot replace its explicit consideration. By involving common bias adjustment procedures with likely effects on diverse basic statistical properties, this study may also help guide climate information users in the determination of adequate bias adjustment strategies for their research purposes.},

	abstract = {Most bias correction algorithms used in climatology, for example quantile mapping, are applied to univariate time series. They neglect the dependence between different variables. Those that are multivariate often correct only limited measures of joint dependence, such as Pearson or Spearman rank correlation. Here, an image processing technique designed to transfer colour information from one image to another—the N-dimensional probability density function transform—is adapted for use as a multivariate bias correction algorithm (MBCn) for climate model projections/predictions of multiple climate variables. MBCn is a multivariate generalization of quantile mapping that transfers all aspects of an observed continuous multivariate distribution to the corresponding multivariate distribution of variables from a climate model. When applied to climate model projections, changes in quantiles of each variable between the historical and projection period are also preserved. The MBCn algorithm is demonstrated on three case studies. First, the method is applied to an image processing example with characteristics that mimic a climate projection problem. Second, MBCn is used to correct a suite of 3-hourly surface meteorological variables from the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis Regional Climate Model (CanRCM4) across a North American domain. Components of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System, a complicated set of multivariate indices that characterizes the risk of wildfire, are then calculated and verified against observed values. Third, MBCn is used to correct biases in the spatial dependence structure of CanRCM4 precipitation fields. Results are compared against a univariate quantile mapping algorithm, which neglects the dependence between variables, and two multivariate bias correction algorithms, each of which corrects a different form of inter-variable correlation structure. MBCn outperforms these alternatives, often by a large margin, particularly for annual maxima of the FWI distribution and spatiotemporal autocorrelation of precipitation fields.},

In particular the success of QM in mitigating systematic RCM errors, its ability to generate “new extremes” (values outside the calibration range), and its impact on the climate change signal (CCS) are investigated. In a cross-validation framework based on a RCM control simulation over Europe, QM reduces the bias of daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperature, precipitation amount, and derived indices of extremes by about one order of magnitude and strongly improves the shapes of the related frequency distributions. In addition, a simple extrapolation of the error correction function enables QM to reproduce “new extremes” without deterioration and mostly with improvement of the original RCM quality. QM only moderately modifies the CCS of the corrected parameters. The changes are related to trends in the scenarios and magnitude-dependent error characteristics. Additionally, QM has a large impact on CCSs of non-linearly derived indices of extremes, such as threshold indices.},

In the process of identifying analogs, one key step is the quantification of the dissimilarity between two climates separated in time and space, which involves the choice of a metric. In this study, six a priori suitable metrics are described (the standardized Euclidean distance, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic, the nearest-neighbor distance, the Zech–Aslan energy statistic, the Friedman–Rafsky runs statistic, and the Kullback–Leibler divergence) and criteria are proposed and investigated in an attempt to identify the best metric for selecting spatial analogs. The case study involves the use of numerical simulations performed with the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM, version 4.2.3), from which three annual indicators (total precipitation, heating degree-days, and cooling degree-days) are calculated over 30-yr periods (1971–2000 and 2041–70). It is found that the six metrics identify comparable analog regions at a relatively large scale but that best analogs may differ substantially. For best analogs, it is shown that the uncertainty stemming from the metric choice does not generally exceed that stemming from the simulation or model choice. On the basis of the set of criteria considered in this study, the Zech–Aslan energy statistic stands out as the most recommended metric for analog studies, whereas the Friedman–Rafsky runs statistic is the least recommended.},

The convergence proof is based on describing the statistics of our estimator using waiting-times distributions, as the exponential or Erlang. We illustrate the proposed estimators and show how they compare to existing methods based on density estimation, and we also outline how our divergence estimators can be used for solving the two-sample problem.},

Supported by a large number of Monte Carlo simulations, we are ensured that this test is sufficiently distribution-free for any practical purposes. We also give a simple analytic expression to make easier the calculation of the critical values of the test probability distribution. To illustrate how the test works, we use it to analyse models of the cosmological evolution of X-ray selected active galactic nuclei and we show that it is a much more sensitive goodness-of-fit test than the χ2.},

	abstract = {Abstract Logistical constraints can limit the number of global climate model (GCM) simulations considered in a climate change impact assessment. When dealing with annual or seasonal variables, one can visualize and manually select GCM scenarios to cover as much of the ensemble’s range of changes as possible. Most environmental systems are sensitive to climate conditions (e.g., extremes) that cannot be described by a small number of variables. Instead, algorithms like k-means clustering have been used to select representative ensemble members. Clustering algorithms are, however, biased toward high-density regions of climate variable space and tend to select scenarios that describe the central tendency rather than the full spread of an ensemble. Also, scenarios selected via clustering may not be ordered: that is, scenarios in the five-cluster solution may not appear in the six-cluster solution, which makes recommending a consistent set of scenarios to researchers with different needs difficult. Alternatively, an automated procedure based on a cluster initialization algorithm is proposed and applied to changes in 27 climate extremes indices between 1986–2005 and 2081–2100 from a large ensemble of phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) simulations. Selections by the method are ordered and are designed to span the overall range of the ensemble. The number of scenarios required to account for changes spanned by at least 90\% of the CMIP5 ensemble members is reported for 21 regions of the globe and compared with k-means clustering. On average, the proposed method requires 40\% fewer scenarios to meet this threshold than k-means clustering does.},

	abstract = {An impressive number of new climate change scenarios have recently become available to assess the ecological impacts of climate change. Among these impacts, shifts in species range analyzed with species distribution models are the most widely studied. Whereas it is widely recognized that the uncertainty in future climatic conditions must be taken into account in impact studies, many assessments of species range shifts still rely on just a few climate change scenarios, often selected arbitrarily. We describe a method to select objectively a subset of climate change scenarios among a large ensemble of available ones. Our k-means clustering approach reduces the number of climate change scenarios needed to project species distributions, while retaining the coverage of uncertainty in future climate conditions. We first show, for three biologically-relevant climatic variables, that a reduced number of six climate change scenarios generates average climatic conditions very close to those obtained from a set of 27 scenarios available before reduction. A case study on potential gains and losses of habitat by three northeastern American tree species shows that potential future species distributions projected from the selected six climate change scenarios are very similar to those obtained from the full set of 27, although with some spatial discrepancies at the edges of species distributions. In contrast, projections based on just a few climate models vary strongly according to the initial choice of climate models. We give clear guidance on how to reduce the number of climate change scenarios while retaining the central tendencies and coverage of uncertainty in future climatic conditions. This should be particularly useful during future climate change impact studies as more than twice as many climate models were reported in the fifth assessment report of IPCC compared to the previous one.},

The criteria used to determine model agreement, however, often ignore the presence of natural internal variability. We demonstrate that this leads to misleading presentations of the degree of model consensus on the sign and magnitude of the change if the ratio of the signal from the externally forced change to internal variability is low. We present a simple alternative method of depicting multimodel projections which clearly separates lack of climate change signal from lack of model agreement by assessing the degree of consensus on the significance of the change as well as the sign of the change. Our results demonstrate that the common interpretation of lack of model agreement in precipitation projections is largely an artifact of the large noise from climate variability masking the signal, an issue exacerbated by performing analyses at the grid point scale. We argue that separating more clearly the case of lack of agreement from the case of lack of signal will add valuable information for stake-holders' decision making, since adaptation measures required in the two cases are potentially very different.},

	abstract = {Quantile mapping (QM) is a technique often used for statistical post-processing (SPP) of climate model simulations, in order to adjust their biases relative to a selected reference product and/or to downscale their resolution. However, when QM is applied in univariate mode, there is a risk of generating other problems, like intervariable physical inconsistency (PI). Here, such a risk is investigated with daily temperature minimum (Tmin) and maximum (Tmax), for which the relationship Tmin {\textgreater} Tmax would be inconsistent with the definition of the variables. QM is applied to an ensemble of 78 daily CMIP5 simulations over Hudson Bay for the application period 1979–2100, with Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) selected as the reference product during the calibration period 1979–2010. This study's specific objectives are as follows: to investigate the conditions under which PI situations are generated; to test whether PI may be prevented simply by tuning some of the QM technique's numerical choices; and to compare the suitability of alternative approaches that hinder PI by design. Primary results suggest that PI situations appear preferentially for small values of the initial (simulated) diurnal temperature range (DTR), but the differential between the respective biases of Tmin and Tmax also plays an important role; one cannot completely prevent the generation of PI simply by adjusting QM parameters and options, but forcing preservation of the simulated long-term trends generates fewer PI situations; for avoiding PI between Tmin and Tmax, the present study supports a previous recommendation to directly post-process Tmax and DTR before deducing Tmin.},

	abstract = {Abstract Univariate quantile mapping (QM), a technique often used to statistically postprocess climate simulations, may generate physical inconsistency. This issue is investigated here by classifying physical inconsistency into two types. Type I refers to the attribution of an impossible value to a single variable, and type II refers to the breaking of a fixed intervariable relationship. Here QM is applied to relative humidity (RH) and its parent variables, namely, temperature, pressure, and specific humidity. Twelve sites representing various climate types across North America are investigated. Time series from an ensemble of ten 3-hourly simulations are postprocessed, with the CFSR reanalysis used as the reference product. For type I, results indicate that direct postprocessing of RH generates supersaturation values ({\textgreater}100\%) at relatively small frequencies of occurrence. Generated supersaturation amplitudes exceed observed values in fog and clouds. Supersaturation values are generally more frequent and higher when RH is deduced from postprocessed parent variables. For type II, results show that univariate QM practically always breaks the intervariable thermodynamic relationship. Heuristic proxies are designed for comparing the initial bias with physical inconsistency of type II, and results suggest that QM generates a problem that is arguably lesser than the one it is intended to solve. When physical inconsistency is avoided by capping one humidity variable at its saturation level and deducing the other, statistical equivalence with the reference product remains much improved relative to the initial situation. A recommendation for climate services is to postprocess RH and deduce specific humidity rather than the opposite.},

While causes are not thoroughly explored, there is a strong relationship between GCM biases in snow albedo feedback during snowmelt and bias correction resulting in unrealistic DTR values. We propose a technique to bias correct DTR, based on comparing observations and GCM historic simulations, and combine that with either bias correcting daily maximum temperatures and calculating daily minimum temperatures or vice versa. By basing the bias correction on a base period of 1961–1980 and validating it during a test period of 1981–1999, we show that bias correcting DTR and maximum daily temperature can produce more accurate estimations of daily temperature extremes while avoiding the pathological cases of unrealistic DTR values.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract A new technique for statistically downscaling climate model simulations of daily temperature and precipitation is introduced and demonstrated over the western United States. The localized constructed analogs (LOCA) method produces downscaled estimates suitable for hydrological simulations using a multiscale spatial matching scheme to pick appropriate analog days from observations. First, a pool of candidate observed analog days is chosen by matching the model field to be downscaled to observed days over the region that is positively correlated with the point being downscaled, which leads to a natural independence of the downscaling results to the extent of the domain being downscaled. Then, the one candidate analog day that best matches in the local area around the grid cell being downscaled is the single analog day used there. Most grid cells are downscaled using only the single locally selected analog day, but locations whose neighboring cells identify a different analog day use a weighted combination of the center and adjacent analog days to reduce edge discontinuities. By contrast, existing constructed analog methods typically use a weighted average of the same 30 analog days for the entire domain. By greatly reducing this averaging, LOCA produces better estimates of extreme days, constructs a more realistic depiction of the spatial coherence of the downscaled field, and reduces the problem of producing too many light-precipitation days. The LOCA method is more computationally expensive than existing constructed analog techniques, but it is still practical for downscaling numerous climate model simulations with limited computational resources.},

	isbn = {978-0-19-509904-1},
	abstract = {This comprehensive text is based on the authors' course notes, refined and updated over 15 years of teaching. The core of the text focuses on water and its transformations. Four chapters lay the foundation, from energy conservation to the ideal gas law, specific heat capacities, adiabaticprocesses, and entropy. An extensive chapter treats phase transitions of water, and a lengthy discussion of the van der Waals equation sets the stage for phase diagrams. Free energy is applied to determining the effect of dissolved substances, total pressure, and size on vapor pressure. The chapteron moist air and clouds discusses wet-bulb and virtual temperatures, isentropic ascent of saturated air, thermodynamic diagrams, stability, and cloud formation. The final chapter covers energy, momentum, and mass transfer, topics not usually considered part of thermodynamics. Measurements areincluded and experiments and observations are suggested, all with the aim of breathing life into equations. The authors are careful to recognize and unafraid to criticize the treatments of thermodynamics that have been unchanged for more than a hundred years.Atmospheric Thermodynamics contains over 200 exercises, mostly applications of basic principles to concrete problems. Often inspired by inquisitive students and colleagues, the exercises cover everything from automobiles and airplanes to baseball, wind turbines, and ground hogs. The authors weavehistory into the text by drawing on original writings rather than using textbook anecdotes, and molecular interpretations are given wherever possible. Assumptions and approximations are carefully laid out, derivations are detailed, and equations are interpreted physically and applied. No previousknowledge of thermodynamics or kinetic theory is assumed, although students are expected to be well-grounded in calculus, differential equations, vector analysis, and classical mechanics.},

	abstract = {The relative humidity (RH) and the dewpoint temperature (td) are two widely used indicators of the amount of moisture in air. The exact conversion from RH to td, as well as highly accurate approximations, are too complex to be done easily without the help of a calculator or computer. However, there is a very simple rule of thumb that can be very useful for approximating the conversion for moist air (RH {\textgreater} 50\%), which does not appear to be widely known by the meteorological community: td decreases by about 1°C for every 5\% decrease in RH (starting at td= t, the dry bulb temperature, when RH = 100\%). This article examines the mathematical basis and accuracy of this and other relationships between the dewpoint and relative humidity. Several useful applications of the simple conversion are presented, in particular the computation of the cumulus cloud-base level (or lifting condensation level) as zLCL {\textgreater}{\textgreater} (20 + t/5)(100 – RH), where zLCL is in meters when t is in degrees Celcius and RH in percent. Finally, a historical perspective is given with anecdotes about some of the early work in this field.},

	abstract = {Indices for climate variability and extremes have been used for a long time, often by assessing days with temperature or precipitation observations above or below specific physically-based thresholds. While these indices provided insight into local conditions, few physically based thresholds have relevance in all parts of the world. Therefore, indices of extremes evolved over time and now often focus on relative thresholds that describe features in the tails of the distributions of meteorological variables. In order to help understand how extremes are changing globally, a subset of the wide range of possible indices is now being coordinated internationally which allows the results of studies from different parts of the world to fit together seamlessly. This paper reviews these as well as other indices of extremes and documents the obstacles to robustly calculating and analyzing indices and the methods developed to overcome these obstacles. Gridding indices are necessary in order to compare observations with climate model output. However, gridding indices from daily data are not always straightforward because averaging daily information from many stations tends to dampen gridded extremes. The paper describes recent progress in attribution of the changes in gridded indices of extremes that demonstrates human influence on the probability of extremes. The paper also describes model projections of the future and wraps up with a discussion of ongoing efforts to refine indices of extremes as they are being readied to contribute to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report.

	abstract = {Several studies evidenced the importance of the knowledge of the bioclimatic comfort for improving people’s quality of life. Temperature and relative humidity are the main variables related to climatic comfort/discomfort, influencing the environmental stress in the human body. In this study, a stochastic approach is proposed for characterizing the bioclimatic conditions through the Humidex values in six sites of Calabria (southern Italy), a region often hit by heat waves in summer months. The stochastic approach is essential, because the available time series of temperature and relative humidity are not long enough and present several missing values. The model allowed the characterization of sequences of extreme values of the Humidex. Results showed different behaviours between inner and coastal stations. For example, a sequence of 20 consecutive days with maximum daily Humidex values greater than 35 has a return period ranging from 10 to 20 years for the inner stations, while it exceeds 100 years for the coastal ones. The maximum yearly Humidex values for the inner stations have a larger range (40–50) than the coastal ones (38–45), reaching higher occurrence probabilities of serious danger conditions. Besides, the different influence of temperature and relative humidity on the Humidex behaviour has been evidenced.},

	abstract = {Over the past century more than 100 indices have been developed and used to assess bioclimatic conditions for human beings. The majority of these indices are used sporadically or for specific purposes. Some are based on generalized results of measurements (wind chill, cooling power, wet bulb temperature) and some on the empirically observed reactions of the human body to thermal stress (physiological strain, effective temperature). Those indices that are based on human heat balance considerations are referred to as "rational indices". Several simple human heat balance models are known and are used in research and practice. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the newly developed Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), and some of the more prevalent thermal indices. The analysis is based on three groups of data: global data-set, synoptic datasets from Europe, and local scale data from special measurement campaigns of COST Action 730. We found the present indices to express bioclimatic conditions reasonably only under specific meteorological situations, while the UTCI represents specific climates, weather, and locations much better. Furthermore, similar to the human body, the UTCI is very sensitive to changes in ambient stimuli: temperature, solar radiation, wind and humidity. UTCI depicts temporal variability of thermal conditions better than other indices. The UTCI scale is able to express even slight differences in the intensity of meteorological stimuli.},

These formulas, coupled with those defining the temperature difference between the two scales, were used to compute new data sets consistent with the temperature scale of ITS-90. These new data sets were then fitted to equations of the original form, yielding new ITS-90 compatible coefficients to the familiar vapor pressure and enhancement factor equations. In addition, the resulting vapor pressure equations were used to produce a set of inverse approximating equations to yield frostpoint and dewpoint temperatures when the vapor pressure is known.

	abstract = {There is a deep disconnect between scientific and public concern about climate change. One reason is that global climate change is a fairly abstract concept with little perceived relevance, so a key challenge is to translate climate-change projections into locally concrete examples of potential impacts. Here we use climate analog analyses as an alternative method for identifying and communicating climate-change impacts. Our analysis uses multiple downscaled general circulation models for the state of Wisconsin, at 0.1 decimal degree resolution, and identifies contemporary locations in North America that are the most similar to the projected future climates for Wisconsin. We assess the uncertainties inherent in climate-change projections among greenhouse gas emission scenarios, time windows (mid-21st century vs. late 21st-century) and different combinations of climate variables. For all future scenarios and simulations, contemporary climatic analogs within North America were found for Wisconsin’s future climate. Closest analogs are primarily 200–500 km to the south-southwest of their Wisconsin reference location. Temperature has the largest effect on choice of climatic analog, but precipitation is the greatest source of uncertainty. Under the higher-end emission scenarios, the contemporary climatic analogs for Wisconsin’s end-21st-century climates are almost entirely outside the state. Climate-analog analyses offer a place-based means of assessing climate impacts that is complementary to the species-based approaches of species distributional models, and carries no assumptions about the characterization and conservatism of species niches. The analog method is simple and flexible, and can be readily extended to other regions and other environmental variables.},

abstract = {Analysis of long-term daily rainfall data for 58 locations in the Southern Sahelian and Sudanian climatic zones of West Africa showed that a significant relationship exists between the date of onset of rains and the length of the growing season. Early onset of rains, relative to the computed mean date of onset for a given location, resulted in a longer growing season. Probabilities of growing season lengths for early, normal and delayed onset of rains have been computed for all the locations. This analysis has important applications in crop planning as well as disaster planning and forms an initial step in concepts such as “Response Farming” or “Weather-responsive Crop Management Tactics” for drought-prone West Africa.},
