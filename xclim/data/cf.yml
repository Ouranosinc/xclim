  ===================
  CF Standard indices
  ===================

  Indicator found here are defined by the team at `clix-meta`_.
  Adapted documentation from that repository follows:

  The repository aims to provide a platform for thinking about, and developing,
  a unified view of metadata elements required to describe climate indices (aka climate indicators).

  To facilitate data exchange and dissemination the metadata should, as far as possible,
  follow the Climate and Forecasting (CF) Conventions. Considering the very rich and diverse flora of
  climate indices this is however not always possible. By collecting a wide range of different indices
  it is easier to discover any common patterns and features that are currently not well covered by the
  CF Conventions. Currently identified issues frequently relate to standard_name or/and cell_methods
  which both are controlled vocabularies of the CF Conventions.
