Indices library
===============

This module contains climate indices functions operating on `xarray.DataArray`. Most of these
functions operate on daily time series, but some might accept other sampling frequencies as well. All
functions perform units checks to make sure that inputs have the expected dimensions (for example
have units of temperature, whether it is celsius, kelvin or fahrenheit), and the the `units`
attribute of the output DataArray.

The `calendar`, `fwi`, `generic`, `run_length` and `utils` submodule provide helpers to simplify
the implementation of the indices.

.. note::

    Indices functions do not perform missing value checks, and do not set CF-Convention attributes
    (long_name, standard_name, description, cell_methods, etc). These functionalities are provided by
    :class:`xclim.indicators.Indicator` instances found in the :mod:`xclim.indicators.atmos`,
    :mod:`xclim.indicators.land` and :mod:`xclim.indicators.seaIce` modules, documented in :ref:`Climate Indicators`.

Notes for docstring
-------------------

The docstrings adhere to the `NumPy`_ style convention and is meant as a way to store CF-Convention metadata as
well as information relevant to third party libraries (such as a WPS server).

The first line of the docstring (the short summary), will be assigned to the output's `long_name` attribute. The
`long_name` attribute is defined by the NetCDF User Guide to contain a long descriptive name which may, for example,
be used for labeling plots

The second paragraph will be considered as the "*abstract*", or the CF global "*comment*" (miscellaneous information
about the data or methods used to produce it).

The third and fourth sections are the **Parameters** and **Returns** sections describing the input and output values
respectively.

.. code-block:: python

   Parameters
   ----------
   <standard_name> : xarray.DataArray
     <Long_name> of variable [acceptable units].
   threshold : Union[str, float, int]
     Description of the threshold / units.
     e.g. The 10th percentile of historical temperature [K].
   freq : Optional[str]
     Resampling frequency.

   Returns
   -------
   xarray.DataArray
     Output's <long_name> [units]

The next sections would be **Notes** and **References**:

.. code-block:: python

    Notes
    -----
    This is where the mathematical equation is described.
    At the end of the description, convention suggests
    to add a reference [example]_:

        .. math::

            3987^12 + 4365^12 = 4472^12
